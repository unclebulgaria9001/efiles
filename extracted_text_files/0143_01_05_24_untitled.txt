Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 12
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, arguedin herOpposition to Summary Judgment that Defendant
had waived her attorney-client and work-product privilege by submitting a lengthy self-serving
affidavit by her attorney Philip Barden in support of her motion for Summary Judgment that
discussed Mr. Barden’s “intent” in allegedly being the main drafter of Defendant’s January 2,
2015 press release. (DE 586 at p. 34) In Reply, Defendant conceded that in submitting Barden’s
declaration, she had waived the work-product privilege, but denied a waiver of the attorney-
client privilege. (DE 620 at p. 11)Despite admitting that Mr. Barden waived the work-product
privilege, Defendant failed to produce all other work product documents. This Motion seeks
production of those documents along with production of all documents previously withheld on
the ground of attorney-client privilege because those,too,were waived by Defendant’s approval
to submit Mr. Barden’s self-serving declarationin support of Summary Judgment.Specifically,
Ms. Giuffre, hereby moves this Court to Order Defendant to produce all work product documents
(including any internal e-mail communications)and all attorney-client communications she has
had with her attorney, Philip Barden, relating to his representation of her, as well as all
documents drafted, edited, or considered by Philip Barden in relation to his representation of
Ghislaine Maxwell, which would include, but not be limited to, those privilegeddocuments
Defendant listed on her privilege logand order Mr. Barden to sit for his deposition in New York
relating to the subject matter of his waiver. See Schultz Dec. at CompositeExhibit 1.
I. BACKGROUND
In her Motion for Summary Judgment, Defendant relies on a post hoc, self-serving
Declaration (“Barden Declaration”) from her English attorney Philip Barden. SeeSchultz Dec at
Exhibit 2, Barden Declaration. Both the Declaration and the briefing forwhich it was drafted
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 12
reference Barden’s “intent”(and other synonymous phrases)regarding his legal advice to
Defendant at least 62 times. The Declaration also reveals attorney client legal advice given to
Defendant, such as:
“I did not ask Ms. Maxwell to respond point by point…what we needed to do was…”
(…)
Moreover, throughout (1) the Barden Declaration; (2) Defendant’s summary judgment
briefing; and (3) Defendant’s attorney’s statements at oral argument heard on February 16, 2017,
Defendant represented to this Court that Barden issued the defamatory statement to the press.
Defendant repeatedly made that false statement despite the fact that the documents show that
Defendant authorized the statement and gave express approval to her press agent to publish the
press release –not Barden –with Barden nowhere to be found on any of these communications.
Defendant persists with this false representation not only despite the documents that prove
otherwise, but alsodespite the fact that Defendant’s press agent’s sworn testimony states
otherwise. Ross Gow testified that Defendant authorized the statement, “command[ed]” him to
release it, and that Barden was wholly out of the loop during the lead up to Defendant’s decision
to publish her defamatory statement. Gow’s testimony is backedup by the email
communications among Defendant and Gow. Yet, despite both documentaryand testimonial
evidence that Barden did not issue the defamatory statement to the press, Defendant persists in
making these representations to the Court. By submitting Barden’s declaration, Defendant has
clearly waived the privilege.
As the Court will recall, Defendant has claimed a privilege in this litigation as to all email
communications between herself and Barden, claiming attorney-client privilege, a privilege that
this Court explicitly upheld. SeeDE 135 March 2, 2016 Opinion Granting in Part and Denying in
Part Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel for Improper Claim of Privilege.

Significantly,Defendant attempts toblame the defamatory press releaseentirely on
Barden. Giving false testimony at her deposition, in an evasive manner, Defendant saidBarden
was the one who actuallyreleased the defamatory statement, pretending that she had nothing to
do with it at all:
Q. Did you issue a statement to your press agent, Ross Gow in 2015, stating that
Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
A. You need to reask me the question.
Q. Sure. Did you issue a press statement through your press agent, Ross Gow, in
January of 2015, stating that Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
-A. Can you ask it a different way, please?

(…)
Q. Did you issue a press statement through your press agent, Ross Gow, in
January of 2015, where you stated that Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote,
obvious lies?
A. So my lawyer, Philip Barden instructed Ross Gow to issue a statement.
SeeSchultz Dec., Exhibit3, Maxwell Depo.Tr. at 201:8-202:11.
Because of this denial in her sworn testimony(which was plainly untrue), Ms. Giuffre
sought to depose her press agent to establish that Defendant (not her attorney or anyone else)
authorized the release of the defamatory statement.
Months later, on the eve of his deposition, Ross Gow produced the “smoking gun” email
in whichDefendant explicitly “command[ed]” him to publish the defamatory statement.See
Schultz Dec. at Exhibit 4, Defendant’s Email to Gow Authorizing Press Release.(As the Court is
aware, Defendant defied this Court’s Order in her refusal toproducethis email she sent Gow,
despite it being responsive to multiple requests for production,and containing six court-ordered
search terms.)

The next day, Gow testified that Defendant authorized the release of the defamatory
material,and that Barden was not part of their discussions in the lead-up to its release. The
-documentary evidence – the emails exchanged between Defendant and Gow –supports this
testimony:
Q. The subject line does have “FW” which to me indicates it’s a forward. Do you
know where the rest of this email chain is?
A. My understanding of this is: It was a holiday in the UK, but Mr. Barden was
not necessarily accessibleat some point in time, so this had been sent to him
originally by Ms. Maxwell, and because he was unavailable, she forwarded it to
me for immediate action. I therefore respond, “Okay, Ghislaine, I’ll go with this.”
SeeSchultz Dec. at Exhibit 5, Gow Depo Tr. at 44:24-45:8
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
A. Defendant Must Produce All Documents And Communications Relating to the
Waived Work Product And Sit For A Deposition.
“The work-product doctrine is waived when documents are voluntarily shared with an
adversary or when a party possessing the documents seeks to selectively present the materials to
prove a point, but then attempts to invoke the privilege to prevent an opponent from challenging
the assertion.” Niagara Mohawk Power Corp. v. Stone & Webster Eng. Corp., 125 F.R.D. 578,
587 (S.D.N.Y.1989). “Generally, the work product privilege is waived when protected materials
are disclosed in a manner which is either inconsistent with maintaining secrecy against
opponents or substantially increases the opportunity for a potential adversary to obtain the
protected information.” Id. at 590. Additionally, “[t]he work product privilege is waived when a
party to a lawsuit uses it inan unfair way that is inconsistent with the principles underlying the
doctrine of privilege. It is well settled that waiver may be imposed when the privilege-holder has
attempted to use the privilege as both ‘sword’ and ‘shield.’ Granite Partners, L.P. v.Bear
Stearns & Co. Inc., 184 F.R.D. 49, 54 (S.D.N.Y.1999) (Sweet, D.J.); see also Coleco Indus., Inc.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 12
v. Universal City Studios, Inc., 110 F.R.D. 688, 691 (S.D.N.Y.1986) (Sweet, D.J.)
(“[Defendant’s] affidavit and attached work product were proffered as a‘testimonial use’ of
materials otherwise privileged. Fairness requires that discovery not be limited only to those
documents which have selectively been disclosed.”).
When a party voluntarily waives its work product privilege in an attempt to use her
attorney’s work product to her advantage, the party must also produce all related documents
including drafts, e-mail communications relating to the work product, documents considered
relating to the work product and any other materials created, received, used or considered
relating in any way to Ms. Giuffre or this litigation, which is the very subject-matter of the
disclosed work-product. See, e.g., Hickman v. Taylor, 329 U.S. 495, 511, 67 S. Ct. 385, 393, 91
L. Ed. 451 (1947) (work product includes “interviews, statements, memoranda, correspondence,
briefs, mental impressions, personal beliefs, and countless other tangible and intangible ways”);
Comprehensive Habilitation Servs., Inc. v. Commerce Funding Corp., 240 F.R.D. 78, 87
(S.D.N.Y. 2006) (partial waiver of work product demanded waiver of all work-product related to
the subject matter of the initial disclosure); Coleco Indus., Inc. v. Universal City Studios, Inc.,
110 F.R.D. 688 (S.D.N.Y. 1986) (finding defendant waived work-product privilege in disclosing
documents that contained legal opinion of defendant's attorney in order to show reliance on
attorney's advice, which also waived privilege for ot
