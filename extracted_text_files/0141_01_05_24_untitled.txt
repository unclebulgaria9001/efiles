PLAINTIFF’S REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO ENFORCE THE COURT’S
ORDER AND DIRECT DEFENDANT TO ANSWER DEPOSITION QUESTIONS
Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Reply in
Support of her Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition
Questions. Defendant argued that Mr. Boies’ questions were outside this Court’s Order. That is
simply untrue. Defendant refused to answer questions that go to heart of the type of questions
this Court specifically ordered Defendant to answer: they could not be more on-point.
None of Defendant’s arguments change the language of this Court’s Order. None of
Defendant’s arguments change the questions Defendant refused to answer. Accordingly, Ms.
Giuffre’s motion should be granted.
I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
Defendant begins her brief with snippets of her self-serving testimony. As the Court is aware,
all of this testimony is directly contradicted by the myriad of other witnesses in this case who
have testified at deposition, including Defendant’s own witness, Tony Figueroa. Defendant has
claimed in her deposition that she did not procure girls for sex with Epstein nor notice the

hundreds of young girls who came and went from the home she shared with Epstein. Her
testimony is directly refuted by multiple witnesses.
Tony Figueroa, Defendant’s own witness, testified that Defendant called him directly,
asking him to bring girls over, that he did bring girls under the age of 18 over, and that he knew
about Defendant’s threesomes with Ms. Giuffre and Epstein.1
Johanna Sjoberg testified that Defendant recruited her for sex with Epstein under the guise
of answering phones. That phone job lasted one day, because her second day Defendant asked
her to start giving massages, and it soon made it clear that Sjoberg’s purpose was to bring
Epstein to orgasm so Defendant didn’t have to all of the time.2
Chillingly, Rinaldo Rizzo, Defendant’s friend’s house manager, through tears, described
how Defendant tried to force a 15 year old Swedish girl to have sex with Epstein through threats
and stealing her passport.3
Juan Alessi, Epstein’s house manager, testified that Defendant was one of the people who
procured the over 100 girls he witnessed visit Epstein, and that he had to clean Defendant’s sex

Police Detective Joseph Recarey, who led the investigation of Epstein, testified that
Defendant procured underage girls for Epstein.8 Indeed, on the morning that Recarey executed

afternoon.9
And though Defendant refused to admit that she flew with Ms. Giuffre,10 Epstein’s pilot,
Dave Rodgers, testified that the passenger listed on his flight log bearing the initials – GM – was
in fact Ghislaine Maxwell and Rodgers was the pilot on at least 23 of the flights in which
Defendant flew with Plaintiff.11

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-7 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 12
Both Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about
-Defendant trafficking girls12 in a previous action, and both failed to show up for their depositions
in this case.
Also in a previous action, Alfredo Rodriguez, another house manager, testified that
-Defendant “knew what was going on” with the underage girls, and threatened him about telling
others.13
Tellingly, Defendant has not been able to procure a single witness - not one - who can testify
that Defendant did not procure girls for sex with Epstein and did not participate in the sex. Even
one of her own witnesses, Tony Figueroa, testified that she both procured girls and participated
in the sex. Indeed, those who knew her well, who spent considerable time in her and Epstein’s
shared household, have testified that she was Epstein’s procuress.
With every deposition taken, the chorus of voices accusing Defendant of being a procurer
of girls for Epstein grows louder and stronger, corroborating Ms. Giuffre’s account, and proving
that Defendant defamed her when she called her a liar.14
In her Response brief, Defendant puts forth the number of questions posed to her in her
deposition; however, the important number is omitted: how many questions she actually
answered. What Defendant fails to tell the Court is how many questions - and how much
deposition time - was taken up by Defendant engaging in improper behavior. Defendant spent
much of her time refusing to answer basic questions so that they had to be repeated multiple
12 See McCawley Decl. at Exhibits 14-15, Sarah Kellen’s March 24, 2010 Dep. Tr. at 37-40, 100;
and Nadia Marcinkova’s April 13, 2010 Dep. Tr. at 29-35, 47-49.
13 See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 16, Alfredo Rodriguez’ July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 176-177;
169-172.
14 Defendant claims that “Plaintiff’s counsel has admitted that it was a mistake to sue Alan
Dershowitz for defamation, after he provided them documentation establishing he never was in
their client’s presence, nor did he have sex with her.” This is simply untrue.

times. She also spent much of her time feigning incomprehension of simple sentences and
common words, also causing the same question to be posed to her multiple times. For example,
defendant pretended not to understand the question, “Do you believe that Epstein abused
minors?,” causing it to be repeated multiple times.
Q. . . . do you believe that Jeffrey Epstein abused any minor children?
A. Can you repeat the question please and break it down so it's more understandable.
Q. Now that you have the police report that I showed you this morning that you had an
opportunity to look at.
A. You gave it to me, I did not look at it.
Q. The questions that I asked you about the police report -- you are aware there is a
police report?
A. I am aware there is a police report.
Q. You are aware there was a criminal investigation of Jeffrey Epstein?
A. I am aware that there was that.
Q. Now that you are aware of those two things and having talked to Jeffrey Epstein, do
you believe Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
A. Can you reask the second part of that question please.
Q. Sure. The two documents we were talking about, the document and the investigation,
you said you are aware of and after having talked to Jeffrey Epstein, do you believe
Jeffrey Epstein sexually abused minors?
A. What do you mean I talked to Jeffrey, you need to break the question down further.
***
Q. Let's take those two things. After knowing those two things, do you believe that
Jeffrey Epstein abused minor children?
A. Can you explain what you mean by the question actually.
Q. I think the question speaks for itself. I will try again. I will say it one more time
because I want you to be able to understand it. Knowing that you have the police
report here and knowing about the criminal investigation, do you believe that Jeffrey
Epstein sexually abused minors?
This sequence goes on and on. Counsel for Ms. Giuffre had to ask Defendant whether she
believed Epstein abused minors fourteen more times after this exchange. 15 Still, Defendant
never answered the question. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, Maxwell’s April 22, 2016 Dep.
