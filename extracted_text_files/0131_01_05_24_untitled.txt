PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSES AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S SECOND
REQUEST FOR PRODUCTION AND DEFENDANT’S INTERROGATORIES,
PLAINTIFF’S ANSWERS TO DEFENDANT’S REQUESTS FOR ADMISSION
Pursuant to Federal Rules of Civil Procedure 26, 33, 34, Plaintiff hereby serves her
responses and objections to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests and serves her
Answers to Defendant’s Requests for Admission.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s Discovery Requests violate Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which provides “a party
may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all discrete subparts” –
in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories in this case, including subparts, in
violation of Rule 33.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to,
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense privilege, public interest privilege,
and any other applicable privilege.

This document is CONFIDENTIAL under the Court’s Protective Order (DE 62)
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery
Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession,
custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that
Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests are duplicative of documents and information
that can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not
relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, are not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Ms. Giuffre further objects because Defendant’s Second
Set of Requests for Production seeks documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this
case. Indeed, they seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that
are not relevant to any party’s claim or defense; and documents that are not proportional to the
needs of the case. Such requests would create a heavy burden on Ms. Giuffre that outweighs any
benefit. Such discovery is prohibited by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly under
the 2015 amendments to Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., and is wholly inappropriate.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they are overly broad and unduly
burdensome, as individually logging all privileged responsive documents would be overly
burdensome. Plaintiff contends that requests targeting such privileged information are overly
broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as
overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing
privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation
commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre additionally objects to the requests as overly
burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents
between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States,

Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida). Accordingly, due to the undue burden of
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a minor victim of sexual trafficking.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent they are overly broad and unduly
burdensome.
Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s Second Set of Discovery Requests as being made
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and
documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or
supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre has produced documents and information in response to
these Requests.
Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.

INTERROGATORIES
5. Identify each Communication that You or Your Attorneys have had with any
author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer, commentator, investigative journalist,
photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter, stringer, or any other employee of any
media organization or independent consultant to the same, including:
a. the date of any such Communication;

This document is CONFIDENTIAL under the Court’s Protective Order (DE 62)
b. the form of any such Communication, whether oral or written and if written, the
format of any such Communication;
c. the identities of all persons involved in such Communication, including, the identity
of the media organization with whom the agent is or was affiliated;
d. the article title, date of publication, and means of publication of any article, report, or
re-printing of any such Communication made by You or Your Attorneys;
e. the amount of Income that You and/or Your Attorneys received in exchange for any
such Communication;
f. the dates on which You and/or Your Attorneys received any such Income for any
such Communication.
Response to Interrogatory No. 5:
Ms. Giuffre objects to this interrogatory in that it violates Rule 33 as its subparts, in
combination with the other interrogatories, exceed the allowable twenty-five interrogatories. Ms.
Giuffre objects in that it seeks information protected by the attorney-client privilege, work
product protections, and any other applicable privilege or protection as stated in the General
Objections.
Ms. Giuffre further objects to this interrogatory on the grounds that it is overly broad and
unduly burdensome as it is not limited in time, manner, or subject matter. The request is grossly
over broad in that it does not require the communication to have any connection with Ms.
Giuffre or this case whatsoever. Indeed, a response to this interrogatory would require each of
Ms. Giuffre’s attorneys to research and find any communication they have ever had with a
journalist, for every year of their practice, regardless of what case was involved, and regardless
of what year the communication was made. Ms. Giuffre’s attorney’s, collectively, have worked

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-5 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 45
This document is CONFIDENTIAL under the Court’s Protective Order (DE 62)
on hundreds (if not thousands) of matters, and collectively have well over 100 years of combined
practice experience. Accordingly, a request that each of these attorneys list all communications
with the media is facially overbroad.
Additionally, Ms. Giuffre objects to this Interrogatory because a response would cause
Ms. Giuffre the incredible and undue burden of having to catalogue literally hundreds of
communications that she has already produced in this case.
Moreover, Ms. Giuffre objects because this interrogatory calls for the production of
documents that are irrelevant to this action and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery
of admissible evidence. Communications with the media regarding cases that bear no relation to
the subject matter of this case, from decades in the past, are facially invalid and not calculated to
lead to the discovery of admissible evidence.
Ms. Giuffre additionally objects to the extent that this interrogatory seeks the
communications of her attorneys, any author, reporter, correspondent, columnist, writer,
commentator, investigative journalist, photojournalist, newspaper person, freelance reporter,
stringer, or any other employee of any media organization or independent consultant as such
interrogatory is overly broad and unduly burdensome. Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre is not obligated
to produce anything currently in the possession of Defendant Maxwell or her attorneys.
Notwithstanding such objections, Ms. Giuffre has already produced her responsive
communications, which are found in documents Bates labelled GIUFFRE000001 to
GIUFFRE007566.
6. Identify any “false statements” attributed to Ghislaine Maxwell which were
“published globally, including within the Southern District of New York” as You contend in
paragraph 9 of Count I of Your Complaint, including:

a. the exact false statement;
b. the date of its publication;
c. the publishing entity and title of any publication containing the purportedly false
statement;
d. the URL or internet address for any internet version of such publication; and the
nature of the publication, whether in print, internet, broadcast or some other form of
media.
Response to Interrogatory No. 6:
Ms. Giuffre objects because the information interrogatory above is in the possession of
Defendant who
