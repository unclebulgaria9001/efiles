PLAINTIFF’S NON-REDACTED MOTION FOR LEAVE TO SERVE THREE
DEPOSITIONSUBPOENAS BY MEANS OTHER THAN PERSONAL SERVICE
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this
Motion for Leave to Serve ThreeDeposition Subpoenas by Means Other Than Personal Service.
The three persons to be subpoenaed –Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen and NadiaMarcinkova–
were each involved in the sexual abuse and sexual trafficking at issue in this case. It appears that
all three of them have evadedattempts to personally serve them (and two of the persons, Epstein
and Kellen, have attorneys who have not been authorized by their clients to accept service). Ms.
Giuffre seeks leaveto provide service by several alternative means that are designed to assure
actual notice is provided to these persons. See Declaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley
Decl.”) at Composite Exhibit 1,Subpoenas for Jeffrey Epstein, Sarah Kellen (aka Sarah
Kensington and Sarah Vickers) and Nadia Marcinkova. This Court has repeatedly held that Fed.
R. Civ. P. 45 permits alternative service in appropriate circumstances, and this case presents such
circumstances. Accordingly, the Court should grant Ms. Giuffre leave to serve deposition
subpoenas by alternative means.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-8 Filed 01/03/24 Page 2 of 12
BACKGROUND
At the heart of this case lies Ms. Giuffre’s allegations that that she was sexually abused
by Jeffrey Epstein and the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre has also alleged that Epstein and the
Defendant were aided by others who played keys roles in the sex trafficking organization,
including Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. Defendant has called Ms. Giuffre a “liar” and
Ms. Giuffre is now in the process of assembling testimony and evidence to prove the truth of her
allegations.
Apart from the Defendant in this case, Jeffrey Epstein is the most important person for
Ms. Giuffre to depose. It was Epstein who gave the directions to Maxwell to recruit Ms. Giuffre
and bring her to Epstein’s mansions to be sexually abused. At several points during her recent
deposition, Ms. Maxwell refused to answer Ms. Giuffre’s questions about Epstein, but instead
told her she should go ask Epstein about the subject. See, e.g., Tr. of Depo. of Defendant (Apr.
22, 2016) at 100 (“Q: … [W]as it Jeffrey’s preference to start a massage with sex? . . . A: I think
you should ask that question of Jeffrey.”); id. at 146-47 (“Q: So would [Ms. Giuffre] be brought
on trips that were for the purpose of work and decorating the house? A: Like I said, I never
worked with her but you would have to ask Jeffrey what he brought her on the trip for.”); id. at
389-90 (“Q: Does [Epstein] . . . have any knowledge of any illegal activity that you’ve
conducted? . . . A: If you want to ask Jeffrey questions about me, you would have to ask him.”).
SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2.
Because of Epstein’s importance to this case, Ms. Giuffre has diligently triedto
personally serve Epstein with a subpoena for his deposition. Epstein, however, appears to have
no interest in answering questions under oath about the scope of his sex trafficking organization
and he has not authorized his lawyer to accept service of the subpoena. On March 7, 2016, Ms.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-8 Filed 01/03/24 Page 3 of 12
Giuffre’s counsel contacted counsel for Epsteinto seek agreement that he would accept service
of the subpoena in this matter. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Composite Exhibit 3,Electronic
Correspondence to Attorney Marty Weinberg. Ms. Giuffre was unable to obtain that agreement
so she retained an investigative company to attempt to locate Epstein for purposes of personal
service1. As explained in the attached affidavit, the Alpha Group Investigators commenced
efforts to personally serve Epstein on April 26, 2016. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4
Affidavit of Douglas G. Mercer, Chief Investigator Alpha Group. Those efforts have continued
for weeks, and included over sixteen (16)attempts to personally serve Epstein, including as
recently as May 18, 2016,at which time the investigator affixed the subpoena to the front door of
Epstein’s residence and mailed copies of the subpoena to both of his New York addressesalong
with a witness check. Counsel for Ms. Giuffre also provided a copy of the subpoena to Marty
Weinberg, Epstein’s attorney.
Jeffrey Epstein is not the only key witness who has been evading Ms. Giuffre’s efforts to
deposethem. The next echelon in the sex traffickingorganization below Epstein and the
Defendant includes Sarah Kellen and Nadia Marcinkova. Ms. Giuffre alleges that they were
heavily involved in the sex trafficking. Both Kellen and Marcinkova appear repeatedly on the
flight logs of Jeffrey Epstein’s aircraft. The U.S. Attorney’s Office for the Southern District of
Florida specifically identified both Kellen and Marcinkova as among four named “potential co-
conspirators of Epstein” in the non-prosecution agreement it executed with Epstein as part of

Giuffre’s counsel contacted counsel for Epsteinto seek agreement that he would accept service
of the subpoena in this matter. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Composite Exhibit 3,Electronic

so she retained an investigative company to attempt to locate Epstein for purposes of personal

1As recently as today, Ms. Giuffre’s counsel continues to attempt to negotiate acceptance of service of
the subpoena for Mr. Epstein, which now includes a request that his deposition take place in the U.S.
Virgin Islandsbut has still not received an agreement to accept service. SeeMcCawley Decl. at

invoked their 5th amendment privileges when asked about their involvementin Epstein and
Defendant’s sex trafficking ring. At her recent deposition, Defendant appeared to be well aware
of the fact that Epstein had potential co-conspirators. See,e.g., Tr. of Depo. of Defendant (Apr.
22, 2016) at 49 (“Q: Are you aware that Sarah Kellen was . . . named as a co-conspirator in the
case involving Jeffrey Epstein? . . . A: I am aware.”). SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 2.
As with Epstein, however, Kellen and Marcinkova appear to be evading efforts to serve
them. On March31, 2016, Ms. Giuffre’s counsel reached out to Sarah Kellen’s counsel to seek
agreement that she would accept service of the subpoena in this matter. SeeMcCawley Decl. at
Exhibit 5, Electronic Correspondence with Bruce Reinhart, of McDonald Hopkins, LLP in West
Palm Beach, Florida. Mr. Reinhart represented that Ms. Kellen refused to allow her counsel to
accept service of the subpoena, so Ms. Giuffre was forced to commence the efforts to attempt to
personally serve her with the subpoena. As explained in the attached affidavit, the Alpha Group
Investigators commencedefforts to personally serve Kellenon April 26, 2016. SeeMcCawley
Decl. at 4,Affidavit of Douglas G. Mercer, Chief Investigator Alpha Group. Those efforts have
continued with over nineteen (19) attempts at service andconcluded as recently as May 18,
2016,at which time the investigator affixed the subpoena to the front door of Kellen’s residence
and mailed copies of the subpoena to both of her New York addresses. Ms. Giuffre’s counsel
also provided a copy of the subpoena to Kellen’s attorney.
Marcinkova has also been evading service. Ms. Giuffre has had her investigators make
efforts to attempt to personally serve Marcinkova at her New York residence,and also made
efforts to try to personally serve her while on a trip to California,but has been unable to obtain
personal service. Ms. Giuffre’s investigators made over ten (10) attempts to personally serve
Marcinkova. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 4,Affidavit of Douglas G. Mercer, Chief

Investigator Alpha Group. In addition, counsel for Ms. Giuffre reached out to Ms. Marcinkova’s
former counsel but he indicated that he could not accept service as he no longer represents her.
SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6,Electronic Correspondence with Jack Goldberger, at
Atterbury, Goldberger & Weiss, P.A., in West Palm Beach, Florida.
In other litigation relating to Jeffrey Epstein, both Marcinkova and Kellen asserted their
fifth amendment rights when asked questions about Defendant’s recruitment of underage girls.
Q Do you know Ghislaine Maxwell?
A Fifth.
Q Is that somebody who helped JeffreyEpstein to devise the scheme to allow him
access to various and a variety of underage minor females?
A Fifth.
Q Is Sarah Kellen somebody that was also involved in the planning of this scheme
to gainaccess to underage minor females?
A Fifth.

Q Isn’t it truethat yourself, GhislaineMaxwell and Sarah Kellen had access to a
masterof list of underage minor females names and phonenumbers so they could
