action, M s. Maxwell will produce such materials subject to an appropriate protective order

OBJECTIONS TO DEFINITIONS
1. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 1 regarding “Agent” because it is an
incorrect statement of the law.
2. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Definition of “communication” to the extent it
expands upon the meaning ascribed to that term by Local Rule 26.3(c).

is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of the

“employ” attorneys.
6. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 7 of “Jeffrey Epstein” to include not only
entities but also any employee, agent, attorney, consultant or representative of him, to include
any entities owned or controlled by him. Questions related to an individual named Jeffrey
Epstein have been construed to mean only that individual and not any other individual who is
affiliated in some capacity with entities owned or controlled by him.
7. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 8 regarding “Massage” to include “any
person touching another person,” as the touching of another person may or may not include what
is commonly understood to mean massage, it may be for a harmful, offensive or accidental
reasons, or for any other purposes, or may be a touching incidental to being in close proximity
with another. Similarly, a definition of “massage” to include “using any object…to touch
another person” can mean a wide variety of activities and for various purposes that exceed the
relevancy of this defamation action.
8. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 9 regarding “Person” to the extent it
expands upon the meaning ascribed to that term by Local Rule 26.3(c).
9. Ms. Maxwell objects to Definition No. 11 regarding “You” or “Your.” The
Definition is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of

the Interrogatories to information in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than
Ms. Maxwell or her counsel.
OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS
1. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 1, in particular the definition of the
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and
unduly burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Complaint at
paragraph 9 purports to describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the
years 1999 – 2002. The Complaint also references statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell
occurring in January 2015. Defining the “Relevant Period” as “July 1999 to the present” is
vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence, and as to certain of the Interrogatories, is intended for the improper purpose of
annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights. Thus, Ms. Maxwell
interprets the Relevant Period to be limited to 1999-2002 and December 30, 2014 - January 31,
2015 and objects to the Interrogatories, except as specifically noted. Without waiver of this
Objection, Ms. Maxwell notes the Court Order in this case which permits discovery regarding
events between 2002 and the present which relate to the topics of the sexual trafficking of
females and will respond to the Interrogatories for the period 2002 to the present on that topic.
2. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 2-21 to the extent they impose
obligations beyond those imposed by Fed. R. Civ. P. 33(b) and Local Rule 33.3. In particular,
the majority of the Instructions pertain to Requests for Production of Documents and are
therefore inapplicable to Interrogatories.
3. Ms. Maxwell objects to these Interrogatories to the extent they exceed those types
of interrogatories permitted by Local Rule 33.3. In particular, the majority of these
Interrogatories do not seek the names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to the
subject matter of this action nor the existence, custodian and location or general description of
relevant documents. Moreover, these Interrogatories are not a more practical method of
obtaining the information sought than a deposition or a request for production of documents.
4. Finally, the contention interrogatories are premature, as other discovery in this
case has not concluded. Local Rule 33.3(c).
5. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Definition of “Identify” to the extent it expands upon
the meaning ascribed to that term by Local Rule 26.3(c).

RESPONSES TO INTERROGATORIES
1. Identify all persons and entities authorized by you or authorized your agent(s) to
make statements on your behalf in January of 2015.
ANSWER:
Ms. Maxwell objects to this Interrogatory as vague and ambiguous, specifically by not defining
what types or topics of “statements” are referred to. As drafted, this Interrogatory calls for
information clearly outside the relevancy of this lawsuit because it implicates her assistant
making work calls for her, scheduling appointments for her and her representatives making
“statements” in all manner of business capacities. Further, Ms. Maxwell objects to this
Interrogatory to the extent it calls for information protected by the attorney/client, attorney work
product and joint defense privileges. Without waiver of the foregoing objections, she responds
as follows:
Ms. Maxwell has no recollection of any non-privileged communication by which she specifically
authorized any agent or entity to “make statements on her behalf in January of 2015” nor
