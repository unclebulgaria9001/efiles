2 THE COURT: I will hear from the movant.
3 MS. MENNINGER: Thank you, your Honor, Laura Menninger
4 on behalf of the defendant Maxwell. We are the movant for the
5 purposes of today's hearing. I filed both a motion to dismiss
6 the complaint, which is based on one claim of defamation, as
7 well as a motion to stay discovery during the pendency of our
8 motion to dismiss the complaint.
9 At the heart of this case, your Honor, defamation is
10 about words, specifically false and defamatory words, about the
11 plaintiff published to another by the defendant with a certain
12 level of culpability and resulting injury. Depending on the
13 context of the words, the content of the statement, the
14 relationship of the speaker and the listener, depending on the
15 time, place and manner of the statement, the Court may find the
16 words to be actionable or not, privileged or not, defamatory in
17 meaning or not.
18 The central problem with this particular complaint,
19 your Honor, is that all of the key elements of defamation are
20 conspicuously absent. Cutting through the hyperbole and the
21 rhetoric contained in the complaint, one is still left
22 wondering what words are actually at issue. Is it the three
23 sentence fragments contained in paragraph 30 against Ghislaine
24 Maxwell are untrue, shown to be untrue, claimed or obvious
25 lies, or does it include some additional or extra false

1 statements that are referenced but never explained in
2 paragraphs 31 and 34? In what context were any of these
3 sentence fragments published? What, if anything, were they in
4 response to?
5 Your Honor has found in previous cases, such as
6 Hawkins v . City of New York, that the failure to identify the
7 individuals to whom the statement allegedly was made and the
8 content of that statement is fatally defective to an attempt to
9 state a libel or slander cause of action.
10 In this case, in this complaint, plaintiff has barely
11 even attributed a few sentence fragments to my client,
12 Ms. Maxwell . She stripped them of any context. She hasn't
13 provided the entire statement in which those sentence fragments
14 were contained, nor the articles in which any of those
15 sentences might have appeared. She has not pled facts, which,
16 as this Court knows, post-Twombly, must be included, not just
17 legal conclusions. She has not pled facts demonstrating actual
18 malice, nor any special damages or facts that would support
19 defamation per se. Because of the many pleading failures , your
20 Honor, I do not believe this complaint should stand.
21 The Second Circuit made quite clear that your Honor
22 has an important gatekeeping function in a defamation case.
23 The Court must ascertain whether the statement, when judged in
24 context, has a defamatory meaning, and also whether it is
25 privileged.

1 As your Honor also found in Cruz v. Marchetto, you
2 cannot rely, as the plaintiff tries to do here, on the less
3 stringent pleading requirements that predated Twombly and
4 Igbal, and furthermore, that the plaintiff must plead facts
5 which support either defamation per se or special damages.
6 Here, your Honor, while there are statement fragments
7 contained in the complaint at paragraph 31, there's not even a
8 complete sentence attributed to my client, Ms. Maxwell. That,
9 your Honor, has been found on numerous occasions to be
10 insufficient to state a cause of action for defamation.
11 Furthermore, the complaint does not state to whom any
12 such statements were made. There is a general allegation that
13 the statements were made, quote, to the media and public, but
14 no media is identified, no publications are identified. While
15 the complaint states at one point that it was published and
16 disseminated around the world, not a single publication is
17 mentioned or attached to the complaint .

1 statements that are referenced but never explained in

1 As your Honor also found in Cruz v. Marchetto, you
2 cannot rely, as the plaintiff tries to do here, on the less
3 stringent pleading requirements that predated Twombly and
4 Igbal, and furthermore, that the plaintiff must plead facts
5 which support either defamation per se or special damages.
6 Here, your Honor, while there are statement fragments
7 contained in the complaint at paragraph 31, there's not even a
8 complete sentence attributed to my client, Ms. Maxwell. That,
9 your Honor, has been found on numerous occasions to be
10 insufficient to state a cause of action for defamation.
11 Furthermore, the complaint does not state to whom any
12 such statements were made. There is a general allegation that
13 the statements were made, quote, to the media and public, but
14 no media is identified, no publications are identified. While
15 the complaint states at one point that it was published and
16 disseminated around the world, not a single publication is
17 mentioned or attached to the complaint .
18 And furthermore, the complaint fails to state where in
19 fact the statements were made. Although it does state the
20 statements were made in the Southern District of New York, it
21 attributes those sentence fragments to a press agent who is
22 admittedly located in London.
23 Finally, your Honor, there is a lot of confusion
24 contained in the paperwork with regard to the standard of
25 malice that must be pled. Again your Honor has found, and

1 numerous other Southern District Courts have found likewise,
2 that malice in this context is malice in the sense of spite or
3 ill will. Looking to the complaint, your Honor, there's not a
4 single conclusory or factually-supported allegation that would
5 give rise to a finding of malice. And that, your Honor,
6 likewise is fatal to the complaint .
7 Finally, in terms of pleading deficiencies, plaintiff
8 in this case has tried to allege defamation per se by claiming
9 her profession is as a professional victim. In other words,
10 ten days before she claims my client made statements about her,
11 plaintiff founded a nonprofit through her organization, through
12 her attorneys in Florida, called Victims Refuse Silence, and
13 thereby states that any attempt to impugn anything she says is
14 defamation per se .
15 There is no support in the case law for a profession
16 of being a victim, your Honor. And likewise, there's no
17 factual support to suggest, and the cases require, that the
18 statements attributed to my client, Ms. Maxwell, have anything
19 to do with her nonprofit organization, nor that my client was
20 even aware of an organization founded a mere ten days earlier
21 and which doesn't appear to have any actual business conduct
22 related to it .
23 So your Honor, I think for all those reasons, the
24 complaint is insufficiently pled and should be dismissed.
25 Our papers go on a little bit further, your Honor, to

1 also argue that to the extent any of these sentence fragments
2 can be pieced together, the statements, at most, are a general
3 denial. In other words, plaintiff admits in the complaint that
4 she started a media campaign against my client, she issued some
5 very salaci ous allegations against my client in the British
6 press and in some pleadings that she filed in Florida. And
7 after having done that, my client, she says, issued a statement
8 that the allegations are quote, unquote, untrue.
9 Repeatedly, cases both in New York State and federal
10 courts have found general denials are not actionable, that
11 individuals have a right, when they have been accused of
12 misdeeds in the press, to respond, so long as they don' t abuse
13 that privilege. And by abuse of privilege, that means
14 including numerous defamatory extraneous statements about the
15 person to whom they are responding and/or excessively
16 publicizing their response.
17 In this case, your Honor, the statement the
18 allegations are untrue is about as plain vanilla as one can
19 find. There's no better way to issue a general denial than to
20 just say that the allegations are untrue, without more.
21 There's not a single reference to plaintiff herself.
22 Although, in opposition, plaintiff claims to have been
23 cal led a liar, complains that she was called dishonest, she
24 doesn't actually point to any statement which contains those
25 words, nor any statement which actually refers to her as a

1 person, simply to the allegations which her client had issued,
2 and frankly, allegations which had been circulated in the
3 press.
4 So saying the allegations are untrue is tantamount to
5 a general denial, and that is one additional reason, your
6 Honor, that I think the complaint should be dismissed.
7 Thank you.
8 MS. McCAWLEY: Good morning, your Honor. May I
9 approach with a bench book?

15 Good morning, your Honor, my name is Sigrid Mccawley,
16 I'm with the law firm of Boies, Schiller & Flexner representing
17 the plaintiff in the case, Virginia Giuffre.
18 With all due respect to my colleague, I think she read
19 a different complaint than the one submitted in thi s case. She
20 left out significant factual details from the complaint that
21 plead actual defamation.
22 This is an old story. A woman comes forth and finally
23 gets the courage to tell about the sexual abuse she endured,
24 and her abusers come public and call her a liar and say her
25 claims are, quote, obvious lies. That quote is in our
