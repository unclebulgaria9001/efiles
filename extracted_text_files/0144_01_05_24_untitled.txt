DECLARATION OF PAUL G. CASSELL IN SUPPORT OF PLAINTIFF’S
OPPOSITION TO PROPOSED INTERVENOR ALAN M. DERSHWOITZ’S MOTION
FOR PERMISSIVE INTERVENTION
I, Paul G. Cassell, declare that the below is true and correct to the best of my knowledge
as follows:
BACKGROUND
1. I am a licensed attorney in the state of Utah. I am authorized to practice before
this Court pursuant to this Court’s Order granting my Application to Appear Pro Hac Vice.
2. I respectfully submit this Declaration in opposition to Proposed Intervenor Alan
M. Dershowitz’s Motion for Permissive Intervention and Unseal of Judicial Documents, or in the
Alternative Modification of the Protective Order.
3. I am the Ronald N. Boyce Presidential Professor of Criminal Law and University
Distinguished Professor of Law at the S.J. Quinney College of Law, where I teach criminal
procedure, criminal, and crime victims’ rights.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-1 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 13
THE FLORIDA CRIME VICTIMS RIGHTS ACT CASE
4. Since July 2008, I have been involved in important and precedent-setting crime
victims’ rights litigation in the Southern District of Florida trying to protect the rights of various
victims under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. § 3771. Along with Florida
co-counsel Bradley J. Edwards, I have been pursuing a federal case pro bono on behalf of two
young women who were sexually abused as underage girls by Dershowitz’s close personal friend
– Jeffrey Epstein.
5. On July 7, 2008, Mr. Edwards filed an emergency petition to enforce the rights of
“Jane Doe No. 1” and “Jane Doe No. 2” under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771, alleging that the
Government had failed to provide them rights with regard to a plea arrangement it was pursuing
with Epstein. DE 1,1 Jane Doe No. 1 and Jane Doe No. 2 v. United States, No. 9:08-cv-80736
(S.D. Fla.). As the case developed, it became clear that the U.S. Attorney’s Office for the
Southern District of Florida had concealed from Epstein’s victims a non-prosecution agreement
(NPA) that they had reached with Epstein.
6. During the litigation, Mr. Edwards and I have won several important victories for
our clients, including a ruling that the CVRA can apply to protect crime victims’ rights even
before an indictment is filed. See Paul G. Cassell, Nathanael J. Mitchell & Bradley J. Edwards,
Crime Victims’ Rights During Criminal Investigations? Apply the Crime Victims’ Rights Act
Before Criminal Charges are Filed, 104 J. CRIM. L. & CRIMINOLOGY 58, 67-69 (2014)
(describing litigation concerning Epstein).
7. In the course of that case, on October 11, 2011, the victims filed discovery
requests with the Government, including requests specifically seeking information about

Dershowitz, Prince Andrew, and others. Further efforts from the Government to avoid
producing any discovery followed (see generally DE 225-1 at 4-5),2 ultimately leading to a
further Court ruling in June 2013 that the Government should produce documents. DE 189. The
Government then produced about 1,500 pages of largely irrelevant materials to the victims (DE
225-1 at 5), while simultaneously submitting 14,825 pages of relevant materials under seal to the
Court. The Government claimed that these pages were “privileged” for various reasons,
attaching an abbreviated privilege log.
8. While these discovery issues were pending, in the summer of 2014, Mr. Edwards
and I contacted Government counsel to request their agreement to add two additional victims to
the case, including Ms. Virginia Giuffre (who was identified in court pleadings as “Jane Doe No.
3”). Edwards and I sought to have her added to the case via stipulation, which would have
avoided the need to include any detailed facts about her abuse. Weeks went by and the
Government – as it had done on a similar request for a stipulation to add another victim – did not
respond to counsel’s request for a stipulation.
9. Finally, on December 10, 2014, despite having had four months to provide a
position, the Government responded by email to counsel that it was seeking more time,
indicating that the Government understood that victims’ counsel might need to file a motion with
the court on the matter immediately. DE 291 at 3-5. Rather than file a motion immediately,
victims’ counsel waited and continued to press the Government for a stipulation. See id. at 5.
Finally, on December 23, 2014 – more than four months after the initial request for a stipulated
joinder into the case – the Government tersely indicated its objection, without indicating any
2 Jeffrey Epstein also attempted to block discovery of materials, leading to an Eleventh Circuit
ruling that the victims’ discovery efforts were proper. Doe v. Epstein, 749 F.3d 999 (11th Cir.
2014).

reason: “Our position is that we oppose adding new petitioners at this stage of the litigation.” See
DE 291 at 5.
10. Because the Government now contested the joinder motion, Edwards and I
prepared a more detailed pleading explaining the justification for granting the motion. One week
after receiving the Government’s objection, on December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre (i.e., Jane Doe
No. 3) and Jane Doe No. 4 filed a motion (and later a corrected motion) seeking to join the case.
DE 279 and DE 280. Uncertain as to the basis for the Government’s objection, the motion briefly
proffered the circumstances that would qualify the two women as “victims” eligible to assert
rights under the CVRA. See 18 U.S.C. 3771(e) (defining “crime victim” protected under the
Act). With regard to Ms. Giuffre, the motion indicated that when she was a minor, Jeffrey
Epstein had trafficked her to Dershowitz and Prince Andrew (among others) for sexual purposes.
Jane Doe No. 3 stated that she was prepared to prove her proffer. See DE 280 at 3 (“If allowed
to join this action, Jane Doe No. 3 would prove the following . . . . “). The motion also provided
specific reasons why Jane Doe No. 3’s participation was relevant to the case, including the
pending discovery issues regarding Dershowitz and Prince Andrew. DE 280 at 9-10 (explaining
several reasons participation of new victims was relevant to existing issues).
11. After the motion was filed, various news organizations published articles about it.
Dershowitz also made numerous media statements about the filing, including calling Jane Doe
No. 3 “a serial liar” who “has lied through her teeth about many world leaders.”
http://www.cnn.com/2015/01/06/us/dershowitz-sex-allegation/. Dershowitz also repeatedly
called Edwards and me “two sleazy, unprofessional, disbarable lawyers.” Id. He made many
similar remarks of an equivalent character, and also stated in media appearance that if we had
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-1 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 13
done one hour of work investigating Ms. Giuffre’s allegations of sexual abuse against him, we
would have immediately seen that those allegations were false.
12. On January 5, 2015, Dershowitz filed a motion to intervene to argue to have the
allegations stricken. DE 282. Dershowitz also argued that Ms. Giuffre had not provided a sworn
affidavit attesting to the truth of her allegations.
13. On January 21, 2015, Edwards and I filed a response for our clients, Ms. Giuffre
and Jane Doe No. 4. DE 291. The response enumerated nine specific reasons why Ms. Giuffre’s
specific allegations against Dershowitz were relevant to the case, including the fact that Ms.
Giuffre needed to establish that she was a “victim” in the case, that pending discovery requests
concerning Dershowitz-specific documents were pending, and that Dershowitz’s role as a
defense attorney in the case was highly relevant to the motive for the Government and defense
counsel to conceal the plea deal from the victims. DE 291 at 17-26 & n.17. The response
included a detailed affidavit from Ms. Giuffre about the sexual abuse she had suffered from
Epstein, Dershowitz, and other powerful persons. DE 291-1.
14. On February 6, 2015, Edwards and Cassell filed a further pleading (and affidavit
from Ms. Giuffre, see DE 291-1) in support of her motion to intervene.
15. On April 7, 2015, Judge Marra denied Ms. Giuffre’s motion to join the case.
Judge Marra concluded that “at this juncture in the proceedings” details about the sexual abuse
she had suffered was unnecessary to making a determination “of whether Jane Doe 3 and Jane
Doe 4 should be permitted to join [the other victims’] claim that the Government violated their
rights under the CVRA. The factual details regarding with whom and where the Jane Does
engaged in sexual activities are impertinent to this central claim (i.e., that they were known
victims of Mr. Epstein and the Government owed them CVRA duties), especially considering
5
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-1 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 13
that the details involve non-parties who are not related to the respondent Government.” DE 324
at 5 (emphasis in original). While Judge Marra struck those allegations, he emphasized that
“Jane Doe 3 is free to reassert these factual details through proper evidentiary proof, should [the
victims] demonstrate a good faith basis for believing that such details are pertinent to a matter
presented for the Court’s consideration. Judge Marra then denied Ms. Giuffre’s motion to join
the case, but allowed her to participate as trial witness: “The necessary ‘participation’ of [Ms.
Giuffre] . . . in this case can be satisfied by offering . . . properly supported – and relevant,
admissi
