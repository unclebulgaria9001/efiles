information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, Rule 408 of the

5. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information which is
not relevant to the subject matter of the litigation and/or is not reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence.
6. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are overly broad, unduly
burdensome and/or propounded for the improper purpose of annoying, embarrassing, or
harassing Ms. Maxwell.
7. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they are vague and ambiguous,
or imprecise.
8. Ms. Maxwell objects to the Requests to the extent they seek information that is
confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s privacy interests.
9. Ms. Maxwell incorporates by reference every general objection set forth above
into each specific response set forth below. A specific response may repeat a general objection
for emphasis or for some other reason. The failure to include any general objection in any
specific response does not waive any general objection to that request.
10. The Requests seek information that is confidential and implicates Ms. Maxwell’s
privacy interests. To the extent such information is relevant and discoverable in this action, Ms.

is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of the
Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms.
Maxwell or her counsel.

an individual, sued in an individual capacity, and therefore there is no “past or present officer,
director, agent or servant” of hers. Additionally, “attorneys” and “paralegals” are not
“employees” of Ms. Maxwell given that she herself is not an attorney and therefore cannot
“employ” attorneys.

Definition is overly broad and unduly burdensome to the extent it attempts to extend the scope of
the Requests to documents in the possession, custody or control of individuals other than Ms.

OBJECTIONS TO INSTRUCTIONS
15. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 1, in particular the definition of the
“Relevant Period” to include July 1999 to the present, on the grounds that it is overly broad and
unduly burdensome and calls for the production of documents that are irrelevant to this action
and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible evidence. The Complaint at
paragraph 9 purports to describe events pertaining to Plaintiff and Defendant occurring in the
years 1999 – 2002. The Complaint also references statements attributed to Ms. Maxwell
occurring in January 2015. Defining the “Relevant Period” as “July 1999 to the present” is
vastly overbroad, irrelevant and not reasonably calculated to lead to the discovery of admissible
evidence, and as to certain of the Requests, is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or
harassing Ms. Maxwell and it implicates her privacy rights. Thus, Ms. Maxwell interprets the
Relevant Period to be limited to 1999-2002 and December 30, 2014 - January 31, 2015, except to
the extent that any the answers “relate to any activity of defendant with respect to the practice
which has been alleged and the duties alleged to be performed by Defendant, ‘activities’ being
defined as sexual abuse or trafficking of any female,” in which case her answers reflect the
period 2000-today. Ms. Maxwell specifically objects to production of any documents outside
that period, except as specifically noted.
16. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 3 on the grounds that it is unduly
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell.
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific disposition of documents, particularly electronic
documents, dating back over 16 years. However, Ms. Maxwell, prior to this litigation has long
had a practice of deleting emails after they have been read.
17. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 5, 8, 9, 12, 17 to the extent they seek to
impose obligations to supply explanations for the presence or absence of such documents, to
specifically identify persons or documents, to provide information concerning who prepared
documents, the location of any copies of such documents, the identities and contact information
for persons who have custody or control of such documents, the reasons for inability to produce
portions of documents, and the “natural person in whose possession they were found,” beyond
the requirements of Rule 34. This Instruction improperly seeks to propound Interrogatories
pursuant to Rule 33.
18. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instructions No. 13 on the grounds that it is unduly
burdensome and is intended for the improper purpose of annoying or harassing Ms. Maxwell.
Ms. Maxwell cannot possibly recall the specific circumstances upon which a document dating
back 16 years has ceased to exist.
19. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction No. 15 to the extent that it calls for documents
or information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, or any other
applicable privilege.
20. Ms. Maxwell objects to Instruction Nos. 18 & 19 to the extent they require
information on any privilege log above and beyond the requirements of Local Civil Rule 26.2.

SPECIFIC OBJECTIONS AND RESPONSES TO PLAINTIFF’S SECOND REQUESTS
FOR PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS
DOCUMENT REQUEST NO. 1
Produce all documents that Your attorneys reviewed and/or relied upon in the March 21,
2016, meet and confer discussion when Mr. Pagliuca stated that (1) Plaintiff made false
allegations concerning her sexual assault; (2) she made them in roughly the same time frame that
Plaintiff was abused by Jeffrey Epstein; (3) that the allegations were made against a number of
individuals in the area; and (4) that the allegations were found to be unfounded by local police.
RESPONSE: Ms. Maxwell has no knowledge of any statements made by Mr. Pagliuca
during the March 21, 2016 meet and confer and hence has no documents responsive to this
Request. Further, this Request inaccurately characterizes the statements of Ms. Maxwell’s
counsel during the March 16, 2016 meet and confer.
Ms. Maxwell further objects to this Request to the extent it seeks documents or
information protected by the attorney/client privilege, the work-product doctrine, the common
interest privilege or any other applicable privilege.
Ms. Maxwell also objects to this Request to the extent it calls for information relating to
Virginia Roberts Giuffre that exists within the public domain, the internet or in public court
records and which are equally available to both parties and can be obtained from some other
source that is more convenient, less burdensome, and less expensive. Subject to and without
waiver of the foregoing, Defendant refers to the public documents and news reports regarding
Plaintiff’s allegations of sexual abuse and investigation of the same, which have been previously
produced, are available in the public domain, or referenced in court papers. Defendant also
refers Plaintiff to documents within the possession, custody and control of Plaintiff and her
counsel, including without limitation Mr. Bradley Edwards, which were requested in
Defendant’s First
