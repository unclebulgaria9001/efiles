PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO ENFORCE THE COURT’S ORDER AND DIRECT
DEFENDANT TO ANSWER DEPOSITION QUESTIONS FILED UNDER SEAL1
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this
Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions. On June 20, 2016, this Court
Ordered Defendant to sit for a second deposition because her refusal to answer questions pos-ed
in her first Deposition (June 20, 2016 Sealed Order, filed in redacted version at D.E. 264-1). Yet,
during her second deposition, Defendant again refused to answer numerous questions regarding
sexual activity related to Jeffrey Epstein in contravention of this Court’s Order. Accordingly, the
Court should direct her to fully answer the relevant questions.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
As the Court is aware, this defamation case involves Ms. Giuffre’s assertions that she and
other females were recruited by Defendant to be sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein under the
guise of being “massage therapists.” See Complaint, DE1, at ¶ 27 (Giuffre “described Maxwell’s
role as one of the main women who Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities

and a primary co-conspirator and participant in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme”).
Numerous other witnesses, with knowledge of Defendant’s activities, have testified to the same:
(cid:120) See Schultz Declaration (“Schultz Decl.”) at Composite Exhibit 1, Excerpts from May
18, 2016, Deposition of Johanna Sjoberg at p. 34:20-35:1. “Q. And did you -- what did
you understand her to mean? A. [Maxwell] was implying that I did not get Jeffrey off,
and so she had to do it. Q. And when you say "get Jeffrey off," do you mean bring him
to orgasm? A. Yes.” . . . “How long did you work for Jeffrey and Ghislaine? A: I
believe it was five years, 2001 to 2006. Q. And how many massages did Epstein receive
per day on average? THE WITNESS: Three.” Id. at pg. 30:15-25. . . “Q. Did Jeffrey
ever tell you why he received so many massages from so many different girls? A. He
explained to me that, in his opinion, he needed to have three orgasms a day. It was
biological, like eating.” Id. at p.32: 9-16.
(cid:120) See Schultz Decl. at Composite Exhibit 2, Excerpts from June 24, 2016, Deposition of
Tony Figueroa at pg. 200:5-18; 96:8-15. “Q. …when Ghislaine Maxwell would call you
during the time you were living with Virginia, she would ask you what specifically? A.
Just if I had found any other girls just to bring to Jeffrey. Q. Okay. A. Pretty much every
time there was a conversation with any of them it was either asking Virginia where she
was at, or asking me to get girls.” “Q What has -- what is that? A. That her [Virginia] and
Maxwell and Jeffrey would obviously be doing stuff, all three of them together. Like I
said that they would all go out to clubs to pick up girls and try to find them to bring back
for Jeffrey. And then she told me about how, like I said, her and Ms. Maxwell and Jeffrey
were all intimate together on multiple occasions.”
(cid:120) See Schultz Decl. at Composite Exhibit 3, Excerpts of June 21, 2016, Deposition of
Detective Recarey at pg. 29:11-20. “Q. “Okay. During your investigation, what did you
learn in terms of Ghislaine Maxwell's involvement, if any? THE WITNESS: Ms.
Maxwell, during her research, was found to be Epstein's long-time friend. During the
interviews, Ms. Maxwell was involved in seeking girls to perform massages and work at
Epstein's home.”
(cid:120) See Schultz Decl. at Composite Exhibit 4, Excerpts from June 10, 2016, Deposition of
Rinaldo Rizzo at pg. 52:8. “A. What happens next when Ghislaine Maxwell and Jeffrey
Epstein and a 15-year-old girl walk into Eva Anderson's home? . . . “A. She proceeds to
tell my wife and I that, and this is not -- this is blurting out, not a conversation like I'm
having a casual conversation. That quickly, I was on an island, I was on the island and
there was Ghislaine, there was Sarah, she said they asked me for sex, I said no. And she
is just rambling, and I'm like what, and she said -- I asked her, I said what? And she says
yes, I was on the island, I don't know how I got from the island to here. Last afternoon or
in the afternoon I was on the island and now I'm here. And I said do you have a -- this is
not making any sense to me, and I said this is nuts, do you have a passport, do you have a
phone? And she says no, and she says Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what, and
she says Sarah took her passport and her phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and at
that point she said that she was threatened.” Id. at pg. 56:2-24

(cid:120) See Schultz Decl. at Composite Exhibit 5, Excerpts from June 1, 2016, Deposition of
John Alessi at pg. 28:6-15. “Q. And over the course of that 10-year period of time while
Ms. Maxwell was at the house, do you have an approximation as to the number of
different females -- females that you were told were massage therapists that came to the
house? THE WITNESS: I cannot give you a number, but I would say probably over 100
in my stay there." Id. at pg. 30:15-25 “Q: Did you go out looking for the girls -- A. No.
Q. -- to bring -- A. Never. Q. -- as the massage therapists? A. Never. Q. Who did?
A. Ms. Maxwell, Mr. Epstein and their friends, because their friends relayed to other
friends they knew a massage therapist and they would send to the house. So it was
referrals.”
In response to Ms. Giuffre’s assertions about Defendant recruiting of females for sexual
purposes, Defendant has made the sweeping claim that Ms. Giuffre’s assertions are “entirely
-false” and “entirely untrue.” Complaint, DE 1, at ¶ 31. Accordingly, this Court directed as
follows:
Defendant is ordered to answer questions relating to Defendant’s own sexual activity (a)
with or involving Jeffrey Epstein (“Epstein”), (b) with or involving Plaintiff, (c) with or
involving underage females known to Epstein or who Defendant believed or intended
might become known to Epstein, or (d) involving or including massage with individuals
Defendant knew to be, or believed might become, known to Epstein. Defendant is also
directed to answer questions relating to her knowledge of sexual activities of others (a)
with or involving Epstein, (b) with or involving Plaintiff, (c) with or involving underage
females known to Epstein or who Defendant believed were known or might become
known to Epstein, or (d) involving or including massage with individuals Defendant
knew to be or believed might become known to Epstein. (FN. Each of the
aforementioned lists are disjunctive.) The scope of Defendant’s answers are not bound by
time period, though Defendant need not answer questions that relate to none of these
subjects or that is clearly not relevant, such as sexual activity of third-parties who bear no
knowledge or relation to the key events, individuals, or locations of this case.
See Schultz Decl. at Exhibit 6, Sealed June 20, 2016, Order at p. 10 (Emphasis added).
Despite this instruction from the Court, during her deposition, Defendant refused to
answer many questions related to “sexual activity with or involving Jeffrey Epstein, with or
involving Plaintiff . . . or involving or including massage with individuals Defendant knew to be
or believed were known to might become known to Epstein.” The result was that at a number of
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-5 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 17
points throughout her deposition, Defendant refused to answer questions about subjects integral
to this lawsuit, including questions about a student, Joanna Sjoberg, who Defendant recruited
from her school to give massages to, and have sex with, Jeffrey Epstein under the guise of hiring
her to answer phones.
For example, Defendant refused to answer questions about recruiting Ms. Sjoberg for sex
with Epstein:
Q. So is it fair to say that Johanna was initially hired to answer
telephones, according to your testimony?
MR. PAGLIUCA: This has already been testified to Mr. Boies. We are repeating
testimony now.
MR. BOIES: I think in the context of the witness’ answers, these are fair
questions. Now, I’ve asked you before, if you want to instruct her not to answer,
if you want to go to the judge, we are happy to do that, but I would suggest in the
interest of moving it along, that you stop these speeches.
MR. PAGLIUCA: You are not moving it along is the problem, so maybe we
should call the court and get some direction here, because I am not going to sit
here and rehash the testimony we already gave.
MR. BOIES: That’s fin[e]. [At this point a telephone call was placed to Judge
Sweet’s chambers].
See Schultz Decl. at Composite Exhibit 7, Excerpts from July 22, 2016, Deposition of Ghislaine
Maxwell at pg.78:17-79:14.
MR. BOIES: So how did it happen, Ms. Maxwell, that Joanna, who had been hired to
answer the phones, ended up giving massages to you and Mr. Epstein.
MR. PAGLIUCA: I’m going to instruct you not to answer the question. This has been
previously , the subject of your former deposition, it doesn’t fall into any of the
categories ordered by the court, and so you don’t need to answer that.
Id. at pg.81:15-25.
Defendant’s counsel’s instruction not to answer was improper. This Court’s Order stated:
“Defendant is also directed to answer questions relating to her knowledge of sexual activities of
others . . . involving or including massage with individuals Defendant knew to be or believed
