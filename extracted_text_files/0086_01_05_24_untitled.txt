PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE AND OBJECTIONS TO DEFENDANT’S
FIRST SET OF DISCOVERY REQUESTS TO PLAINTIFF
Plaintiff hereby serves her responses and objections to Defendant’s First Set of
Discovery Requests.
GENERAL OBJECTIONS
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests violates Local Civil Rule 33.3.Defendant
has served interrogatories that are in direct violation of that Rulebecause the interrogatories are
not “restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with knowledge of information relevant to
the subject matter of the action, the computation of each category of damage alleged, and the
existence, custodian, location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar nature.” Local
Civil Rule 33.3(a). Instead, they seek information under subsections (b) and (c) of Local Civil
Rule 33.3, and therefore, they should not be served because they are not “a more practical
method of obtaining the information sought than a request for production or a deposition,” and
because they were served in advance of the period “30 days prior to the discovery cut-off date.”
Local Civil Rule 33.3(b), (c). The interrogatories you served violate Local Rule 33.3 and we ask
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-2 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 40
that you immediately withdraw those interrogatories. See Rule 33.3, Local Rules for the
Southern District of New York; see alsoShannon v. New York City Transit Auth., No. 00 CIV.
5079 (Sweet, J.), 2001 WL 286727, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. Mar. 22, 2001); accord Gary Friedrich
Enterprises, LLC v. Marvel Enterprises, Inc., No. 08 CIV. 1533 BSJ JCF, 2011 WL 1642381, at
*4 (S.D.N.Y. Apr. 26, 2011). Specifically,Rule 33.3 provides:
(a) Unless otherwise ordered by the Court, at the commencement of discovery,
interrogatories will be restricted to those seeking names of witnesses with
knowledge of information relevant to the subject matter of the action, the
computation of each category of damage alleged, and the existence, custodian,
location and general description of relevant documents, including pertinent
insurance agreements, and other physical evidence, or information of a similar
nature.
(b) During discovery, interrogatories other than those seeking information described
in paragraph (a) above may only be served (1) if they are a more practical method
of obtainingthe information sought than a request for production or a deposition,
or (2) if ordered by the Court.
(c) At the conclusion of other discovery, and at least 30 days prior to the discovery
cut-off date, interrogatories seeking the claims and contentions of the opposing
party may be served unless the Court has ordered otherwise.
Similarly, Requests for Production numbers 1, 2, 4, 6(i), 9, 12, 30, 35 and 37 also violate
Local Rule 33.3 in that they rely on the offending interrogatory requests. The Rule provides that
a party must first try to obtain discovery through document production and testimony. Discovery
does not close in this case until July 1, 2016, and Defendant has not yet noticed a deposition. As
such, these interrogatories violate Local Rule 33.3 and are premature.
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests also violates Rule 33, Fed. R. Civ. P., which
provides “a party may serve on any other party no more than 25 interrogatories, including all
discrete subparts” – in that Defendant has served a total of 59 interrogatories, including subparts,
in violation of Rule 33. We ask that you immediately withdraw those interrogatoriesthat exceed
the 25 interrogatory limit set by Rule 33.

Ms. Giuffreobjects to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to,
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, agency
privilege, investigative privilege, spousal privilege,doctor/patient privilege, accountant/client
privilege, and any other applicable privilege.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s First Set of Discovery
Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession,
custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests is duplicative of documents and information that
can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not
relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, arenot reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Many of the requests in the Defendant’s First Set of
Discovery seek documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this case. Indeed, they
seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that are not relevant

Ms. Giuffreobjects to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests to the extent they
seek information that is protected by any applicable privilege, including but not limited to,
attorney client privilege, work product privilege, joint defense/common interest privilege, agency
privilege, investigative privilege, spousal privilege,doctor/patient privilege, accountant/client
privilege, and any other applicable privilege.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent Defendant’s First Set of Discovery
Requests call for the production of documents or information that is already in the possession,
custody, or control of the Defendant. Ms. Giuffre further objects to the requests to the extent that
Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests is duplicative of documents and information that
can equally or more readily be obtained by the Defendant.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they seek documents that are not
relevant, material, or necessary to this action and, thus, arenot reasonably calculated to lead to
the discovery of admissible evidence. Many of the requests in the Defendant’s First Set of
Discovery seek documents that are in no way limited to their relation to this case. Indeed, they
seek documents that are not important to resolving the issues; documents that are not relevant to
any party’s claim or defense; anddocuments that are not proportional to the needs of the case.
Such requests create a heavy burden on Ms. Giuffre that outweighs any benefit.Such discovery
is prohibited by the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, particularly under the 2015 amendments to
Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P., and is wholly inappropriate.
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent that they are overly broad and unduly
burdensome, as individually logging all privileged responsive documents would be overly
burdensome. Plaintiff contends that requests targeting such privileged information are overly
broad under Rule 26(b)(1), Fed. R. Civ. P. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-2 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 40
overly burdensome to the extent that they would require logging voluminous and ever-increasing
privileged communications between Ms. Giuffre and her counsel after the date litigation
commenced on September 21, 2015. Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests as overly burdensome to
the extent that they would require logging voluminous privileged documents between Ms.
Giuffre and her counsel related to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 v. United States, Case no. 08-
80736-CIV-Marra, pending in the Southern District of Florida; Bradley Edwards and Paul
Cassell v. Alan Dershowitz, Case no. CACE 15-000072, pending in the Seventeenth Judicial
Circuit, Broward County, Florida; and Jane Doe No. 102 v. Jeffrey Epstein, Case No. 09-80656-
CIV-Marra/Johnson (Southern District of Florida). Accordingly, due the undue burden of
individually logging responsive privileged documents related to Defendant’s overly broad
requests, Plaintiff has employed categorical logging of such privileged responsive documents
pursuant to Local Civil Rule 26.2(c).
Ms. Giuffre objects to the requests in that they seek to invade her privacy for the sole
purpose of harassing and intimidating Ms. Giuffre who was a victim of sexual trafficking. Ms.
Giuffre objects to the requests to the extent theyare overly broad and unduly burdensome.
Ms. Giuffre objects to Defendant’s definition of “your attorneys” because it includes
names of attorneys that do not represent her,including Spencer Kuvin and Jack Scarola.
Ms. Giuffre’s responses to Defendant’s First Set of Discovery Requests are being made
after reasonable inquiry into the relevant facts, and are based only upon the information and
documentation that is presently known to her. Ms. Giuffre reserves the right to modify and/or
supplement her responses. Ms. Giuffre is producing documents and information herewith,and
she will continue to review and produce relevant documents until completion.
Ms. Giuffre incorporates her above-listed general objections in the responses herein.
