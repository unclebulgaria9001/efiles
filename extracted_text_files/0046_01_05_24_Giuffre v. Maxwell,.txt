Re: Giuffre v. Maxwell,
Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
Dear Judge Sweet,
This is a reply letter in support of Ms. Giuffre's letter motion to allow for the newly
discovered wi lness, Sarah Ransome, to be called as a witness at trial because she can testify
about Defendant's involvement in Epstein's sex tratficking ring based on first-hand experiences
and first-hand observations.
Defendant Violated Rule 26 By Failing To Disclose This Critical Witness
Defendant argues that Ms. Giuffre is somehow to blame for the fact that Sarah Ransome
is only now being discussed as a witness in this case. But Ms. Giuffre only recently learned
about this witness because Defendant failed to properly disclose her months earlier. ln her
response, Defendant does not address the fact that Ms. Ransome and Ms. Maxwell know each
other. Indeed, Defendant does not address the fact that Ms. Ransome and she spent time together
on Mr. Epstein's private island, as reflected in the flight logs showing Ms. Ransome flying to
and from the island (where Ms. Maxwell was present):

As reflected in the above flight log, on December 10, 2006 (Flight# 1919), Sarah
Ransome flew from EWR (Newark, NJ) to TIST (USVI) with Jeffrey Epstein, Jennifer Kalin,
and Natalya Malyshev. On December 14, 2006 (Flight #1920), Sarah Ransome flew from TIST
(USVI) to EWR (Newark, NJ) with Jeffrey Epstein and Jadia Marcinkova. See Giuffre 07139.
Ms. Ransome was also flown commercially to Jeffrey Epstein's Island several times.
Defendant was obligated under Rule 26 to include Ms. Ransome in her Rule 26
disclosures: Defendant knows that Ms. Ransome is an "individual likely to have discoverable
information." Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(a)(A)(i). As Ms. Ransome will testify, Defendant was on the
island with her and interacted with her on a regular basis. Defendant's refusal to disclose her is
not only (yet another) discovery violation, but also a part of the secrecy that Defendant and
Epstein strove to maintain surrounding their sex trafficking ring. Defendant should not be
allowed to participate in a sex trafficking ring, conceal the witnesses (and victims) of that ring,
and then proclaim "surprise" when Ms. Giuffre succeeds in locating one of the victims. Simply
put, she should not be allowed to benefit from her obvious failure to properly disclose Ms.
Ransome.
Ms. Ransome's Testimonv is ot Cumulative And Has Highly Relevant Evidence
Defendant also advances the remarkable argument that it is "unlikely" that Ms. Ransome
will have relevant information. Yet Ms. Ransome witnessed-first hand - Defendant's
involvement in sex trafficking with Jeffrey Epstein. or will her testimony be cumulative. First,
at the heart of this case is Defendant's sworn testimony that she was not involved in sex

oath in numerous ways .

involvement in the sex trafficking ring, like Ms. Giuffre, Ms. Ransome was also required to
engage in sexual acts with Jeffrey Epstein and Alan Dershowitz.
In addition to spending time with Jeffrey on his island, I spent time with him in New
York City ... Among the people he lent me to was his friend Alan Dershowitz. On one
occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia
Marcinkova. After a short time, Alan Dershowitz entered the room after which Jeffrey
left the room and Nadia and I had sex with Dershowitz ...
See Exhibit A. Affidavit of Sarah Ransome. The testimony of Ms. Ransome goes to the heart of
this defamation claim-whether or not Ms. Giuffre was truthful in her claims about Defendant's
involvement in Epstein's sex trafficking ring, and the Com1 should allow the jury to hear her.
Ms. Giuffre Has Diligently Participated In Discovery And Promptly Disclosed Ms.
Ransome A ftcr Conducting Due Diligence
Defendant also insinuates that Ms. Giuffre has delayed in disclosing Ms. Ransome. But
as the Court is well aware, Ms. Giuffre has previously diligently disclosed close lo 100
individuals who may have relevant information in her Rule 26 disclosures. By contrast,
Defendant's Rule 26 disclosures never listed Ms. Ransome as a witness, despite the fact that
Defendant was in her company on several occasions including on Epstein's island, where Ms.
Ransome was one of several girls being sexually trafficked for Epstein upon the direction and
insistence of Defendant. After being contacted by Ms. Ransome, counsel for Ms. Giuffre
properly conducted a due diligence investigation into whether the information she provided had
merit. Specifically, Ms. Giuffrc's counsel undertook the expense to fly to Europe to meet in
person with this newly disclosed witness on January 4, 2017, returnfog on January 6, 2017, to
fully evaluate her credibility. Upon evaluating the witness and upon the witness confirming that
she was willing to sign an affidavit under oath regarding her testimony, Ms. Giuffre ananged to
have a sworn affidavit executed at the U.S. Embassy in the country where Ms. Ransome resides.
Ms. Giuffre then issued revised Rule 26 disclosures on January 13, 2017 and informed
Defendant that she would produce Ms. Ransome for a deposition as a newly-disclosed witness
immediately so as to avoid any prejudice or delay in the March 13, 2017 trial date. In short, Ms.
Giufii·e acted promptly and reasonably after being contacted by this victim of Epstein's and
Defendant's sex trafficking ring.

Defendant Not Re Prejudiced Because Ms. Ransome is Readily AvailabJc for
Deposition

Defendant's argument about her alleged burden from allowing this one additional witness
also rings hollow. 1 Defendant complains about her alleged lack of resources, but as this Court is
aware, Defendant is a wealthy socialite (wbo recently sold her New York Townhome for $15
million dollars) who has heavily litigated this case in ways that were completely unnecessary. 2
Moreover, deposition discovery is still ongoing in this case. Ms. Kellen sat for her
deposition last week (wherein she invoked the Fifth Amendment when asked about Defendant's
involvement in Epstein's sex trafficking ring) along with Ms. Marcinkova who was recently
deposed on January 17, 2017. Due to Defendant's unwillingness to produce her agent, Ross
Gow for deposition, Ms. Giuffre did not get to depose him until November 18, 2017 at which
time he produced never-before-seen documents that are critical to this case. Defendant has yet to
sit for her follow-up deposition that was directed by the Court but for which Defendant filed a
"Motion for Reconsideration" on November 16, 2016, which is still pending. Needless to say,
while the official discovery deadline has closed, certain depositions have been taken more
recently due to issues with witness cooperation. Of course, if Defendant does not desire to take
Ms. Ransome's deposition, then Ms. Giuffre is content simply calling her at trial. But Defendant
will hardly be prejudiced by allowing a witness to testify who is available for deposition.
1 Defendant argues that because Jane Doe 43 (who for purposes of this sealed filing we
can identify as Ms. Ransome) has recently filed a complaint against multiple defendants for
violations of sex trafficking laws that Defendant should get to reopen discovery and further
investigate everyone named as a Defendant. Notably, these are all individuals that were part of
the sexual trafficking ring that Defendant was a party to and she has known about them and
interacted with them for years. Ms. Ransome's claim had to be filed swiftly because her statute
of limitations was continuing to run and the details of her allegations only recently became
known lo counsel. In any event, the questions that need to be asked of Ms. Ransome a
