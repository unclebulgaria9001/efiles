Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-4 Filed 01/05/24 Page 1 of 27
UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE,
Index No. 15 Civ. 7433 (RWS)
Plaintiff,
-against- REPLY DECLARATION OF
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ IN
GHISLAINE MAXWELL, FURTHER SUPPORT OF
MOTION TO INTERVENE
Defendant. AND UNSEAL
ALAN M. DERSHOWITZ declares under penalty of perjury that the following
is true and correct:
1. I am personally familiar with the facts set forth in this Reply Declaration,
which I submit in further support of my pending motion to intervene and to unseal the
“Requested Documents,” as that term is defined in Paragraph 3 of my August 11, 2016
Declaration.
Introduction and Overview
2. Rather than offering a valid and proper basis for opposing my motion, the
papers submitted on behalf of plaintiff Virginia Roberts Giuffre—particularly, the lengthy
declaration of Paul Cassell, one of Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers and a former federal judge—are little
more than an effort to revive and further the false and scurrilous allegations of sexual misconduct
that compelled me to seek the Court’s assistance in the first place. As his declaration makes
clear, Mr. Cassell has crossed the line from being a legitimate advocate for a client, to being a
lawyer who is seeking to justify his own conduct in the face of compelling evidence that his
client is a thoroughgoing liar. That was, after all, the gravamen of Mr. Cassell’s defamation case
against me: the assertion, now repeated at length before this Court, that Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-4 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 27
had a valid basis for disseminating her false, grotesque and impertinent allegations against me in
a public filing. And it is that “fight,” essentially, that Mr. Cassell reignites in his declaration in
this matter. To be clear, this not a fight that that I started and it is certainly not one that I am
asking this Court to referee or resolve in any way. I am only asking that the Court refuse to
allow its Protective Order, which was entered based upon a stipulation that explicitly
contemplated that the Order might be modified, from being used to prevent me from disclosing
documents that reveal the truth. Having now, again, been subjected to an unfair and unwarranted
false attack on my credibility and reputation for personal rectitude, I have no choice but to
respond on the merits.
3. I begin by, again, swearing under oath that I did not sexually abuse
Virginia Roberts Giuffre, and that any allegation or suggestion to the contrary is categorically
false. I never had sexual contact with Ms. Giuffre of any kind, and, to my knowledge, I never
even met her until her deposition in 2016. By swearing to this, I am deliberately exposing
myself to a perjury prosecution and disbarment if I am not telling the truth. If Ms. Giuffre were
to submit an affidavit repeating her false allegations against me, I would welcome and cooperate
with a criminal investigation by any prosecutorial office as to whether it is Ms. Giuffre or I who
is committing perjury. It is inescapably clear that one of us is lying under oath. I know it is not
me.
4. Against this backdrop, and the facts set forth in my August 11, 2016
Declaration, Mr. Cassell, on his client’s behalf, has put into the record a declaration replete with
factual inaccuracies, omissions, and flat-out misrepresentations. Among other things, he
misstates important elements of both the Crime Victims’ Rights Act lawsuit filed by Ms. Giuffre,
and others, in Florida (the “CVRA Action”), and the defamation lawsuit that he and his
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-4 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 27
colleague, Bradley Edwards, brought against me (Edwards v. Dershowitz, Case No. CACE
15-000072 (Cir. Ct., Broward Cnty., Fla.)). Moreover, he elides or mischaracterizes testimony
gathered in those and other proceedings in order to make them appear inculpatory of me when, in
fact, they are just the opposite.
5. In doing so, Mr. Cassell seeks to accomplish two goals simultaneously:
first, to suppress information—the Requested Documents—which exculpates me from the
charges of sexual misconduct, while allowing Ms. Giuffre and her allies to publicly disseminate
those selected “facts” that, they believe, support her allegations against me; and, second, to prove
that Mr. Cassell—and , by extension, his colleague Mr. Edwards and Ms. Giuffre’s current
lawyers at Boies Schiller & Flexner, LLP—have a valid factual basis for continuing to press Ms.
Giuffre’s false allegations. Mr. Cassell’s effort is an unmitigated failure, as this declaration
demonstrates.
6. While much of the Cassell Declaration goes far beyond what is reasonably
required to respond to the instant motion, and while it surely has the distinct air of “protesting
too much,” I cannot stand mute in the face of this continuing assault on my character. As this
declaration and the accompanying reply brief will demonstrate, the charges against me are
baseless, a

6. While much of the Cassell Declaration goes far beyond what is reasonably
required to respond to the instant motion, and while it surely has the distinct air of “protesting
too much,” I cannot stand mute in the face of this continuing assault on my character. As this
declaration and the accompanying reply brief will demonstrate, the charges against me are
baseless, and unsealing the Requested Document is the only proper response to Ms. Giuffre’s
efforts to smear me through the legal process.
7. In its effort to block the unsealing of the Requested Documents and to
justify Ms. Giuffre’s lawyers’ decision to represent her, the Cassell Declaration cites five
sources: (i) a Palm Beach Police Department Report dated July 19, 2006; (ii) flight logs for the
aircraft owned by Jeffrey Epstein; (iii) the fact that a “very well-regarded Florida” lawyer filed a
civil complaint against Mr. Epstein on Ms. Giuffre’s behalf which accused “academicians”
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-4 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 27
associated with Mr. Epstein of abusing her; (iv) the testimony of Juan Alessi and Alfredo
Rodriguez, two household employees of Mr. Epstein; and (v) what Mr. Cassell alleges is a
“pattern of deception” by me to keep the “truth” from coming out. I will address each of these,
in detail, in turn. As will immediately become clear, the information presented by Mr. Cassell in
no way substantiates Ms. Giuffre’s claims. To the contrary, much of the evidence contradicts
Ms. Giuffre’s version of events. In addition, I offer a few final points about matters that
demonstrate clearly that Ms. Giuffre is not a credible witness.
The Palm Beach Police Department Report
8. The Cassell Declaration cites a July 2006 Palm Beach Police Department
Report, which identified Jeffrey Epstein’s home in Palm Beach as a location at which Mr.
Epstein allegedly abused minor victims. Mr. Cassell contends that this Report supports Ms.
Giuffre’s account that I abused her at the Palm Beach home. See Cassell Decl., ¶ 21(a)-(b).
1111
But, as Mr. Cassell conceded in his deposition in the Edwards defamation case, my name does
not even appear in the Palm Beach Police Department Report—much less does the Report
contain an allegation that I sexually abused someone. See Ex. O at 31 (Deposition Transcript of
Paul G. Cassell, October 16-17, 2015).
9. Mr. Cassell asserts that the Palm Beach Police Report “showed the sexual
abuse was occurring on a daily basis” at the Epstein mansion, and thus “that [it] would have
made it obvious to a visiting guest that young girls were coming to the home for sexual
purposes.” Cassell Decl., ¶ 21(b). Putting aside the conclusory nature of the inference (For
example, by what means would it be “obvious,” and to which “guests?” I would think that if
someone were doing something illegal, such as arranging trysts with underage girls, they would
take measures to conceal their conduct), the statement is entirely irrelevant to me. First, I was
not present in that home—or on Mr. Epstein’s private island, or at his New Mexico ranch, or on
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-4 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 27
his airplane—during the time Ms. Giuffre was associated with him. Dershowitz Decl.,1 ¶ 9.
Nothing about Ms. Giuffre’s relationship with Mr. Epstein, or her age, could have been
“obvious” to me, because I never met her. Second, there is simply no evidence that Mr.
Epstein’s alleged abuse of minor victims at his home in Palm Beach was “obvious” or known to
any “visiting guests,” given that the abuse took is alleged to have taken place in a separate part
of the house, namely Mr. Epstein’s private bedroom.
10. Ms. Giuffre and her counsel have alleged that she was not the only “young
girl” that I had sexual contact with – i.e., that there were others. Of course, no such persons have
ever presented themselves to corroborate this accusation. Nonetheless, Mr. Cassell latched on to
this allegation as a “basis” for his filing in the CRVA Action, which named me as a serial abuser.
11. Demonstrating how little Mr. Cassell really had to go on in this regard, I
ask the Court to consider Mr. Cassell’s response to a question put to him in deposition
concerning who, other than his client, he had reason to believe was abused by me. All Mr.
Cassell could muster was this:
[CASSELL]: …I have 24 names in mind as possible sexual abuse
victims that Dershowitz may or may not have abused. And I have
not been able to pinpoint exactly what happened, because the
people who would be in the best position to help me sort out what
the names were [--] specifically Jeffrey Epstein, among others [--]
have refused to cooperate and give me those names” (emphasis
added).
Ex. O at 36-37.
12. The very idea that Mr. Cassell could claim that, without more, a mere list
of alleged victims that he believes that I “may or may not have abused” would provide a basis for
publicly accusing me of heinous crimes, well illustrates Mr. Cassell’s mindset.
