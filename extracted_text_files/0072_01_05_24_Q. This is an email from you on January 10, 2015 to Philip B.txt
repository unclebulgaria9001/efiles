PLAINTIFF’S SUPPLEMENT TO MOTION FOR ADVERSE INFERENCE
INSTRUCTION BASED ON NEW INFORMATION
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files this
Supplement to her Motion for Adverse Inference Instruction Based on New Information. Eleven
months into this case, and after the close of fact discovery, Defendant continues to refuse to
abide by her most basic and fundamental discovery obligations. A summary of this ongoing and
willful non-compliance, as well as a supplement to her motion for an adverse inference
instruction based on new information, follows. Most notably, Defendant claims to have run
search terms and reviewed over 10,000 documents, but, remarkably, claims that not a single
-document - not one - is relevant to this litigation, and therefore produced nothing with respect to
the search.
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
On October 27, 2015, Ms. Giuffre submitted her first set of Requests for Production.
Defendant failed to make a reasonable search or production of her documents, and Ms. Giuffre
sought relief from the Court numerous times:

(cid:120) Plaintiff’s Response in Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for a Protective Order
Regarding Defendant’s Deposition (DE 70) - Defendant’s Motion Denied (DE 106).
(cid:120) Plaintiff’s Motion for Forensic Examination (DE 96) - Granted in part (June 20, 2016
Sealed Order).
(cid:120) Plaintiff’s Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions (DE 143) –

(cid:120) Plaintiff’s Motion for Adverse Inference Instruction (DE 279) - Pending.
(cid:120) Plaintiff’s Motion to Enforce the Court's Order and Direct Defendant to Answer
Deposition Questions (DE 315) - Pending.
On June 20, 2016, this Court Granted in Part Ms. Giuffre’s Motion for Forensic Exam,
•
and directed Defendant to capture her data and run mutually agreed-upon search terms. The
Court also ordered Defendant to produce documents to Ms. Giuffre by July 11, 2016. (This part
of the Court’s Order is not under seal and can be found at DE 264-1). On June 30, 2016, and on
July 8, 2016, counsel for Ms. Giuffre sent letters to Defendant following up on this Order and
proposing search terms (attached as exhibits to DE 279). Defendant did not respond. The July 11,
2016, deadline passed without any production from Defendant.
On July 13, 2016, Ms. Giuffre moved for an adverse inference instruction (DE 279).
Thereafter, the Court denied Defendant’s motion to strike Ms. Giuffre’s motion for an adverse
inference instruction, directing the parties to submit search terms to the Court on August 1, 2016,
advising that “[a] briefing schedule and the submission date will be set after search terms are
determined.” (DE 301).
Pursuant to this Court’s July 22, 2016, on Monday, August 1, 2016, Ms. Giuffre filed the
list of search terms that Ms. Giuffre believes should be run over Defendant’s data. (DE 323).

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 21
II. DISCUSSION
At a minimum, the Court should direct Defendant to run the search terms in the list
originally submitted by Ms. Giuffre. More broadly, the Court should grant Ms. Giuffre’s request
for an adverse inference based on the incurable prejudice she has suffered as a result of
-Defendant’s failure to comply with her discovery obligations and this Court’s June 20, 2016,
Order.
A. Defendant’s Refusal to Even Run Ms. Giuffre’s Name as a Search
Term.
Defendant has been recalcitrant in running even the most basic searches of electronic
data. For example, in a letter sent on June 8, 2016, and in a meet and confer call on July 26,
2016, counsel for Ms. Giuffre asked Defendant to run Ms. Giuffre’s name as a search term to
find documents responsive to (for example) Ms. Giuffre’s Request No. 12, which sought
Defendant’s documents relating to Ms. Giuffre. That request was refused in writing on Friday,
July 29, 2016, at 7:02 p.m. (EST). See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, July 29, 2016, 7:02 p.m.,
Letter from Ty Gee to Ms. Schultz (refusing to run Ms. Giuffre’s name as a search term as part
of effort to identify responsive documents). Specifically, Mr. Gee’s letter said that such a search
term was inappropriate because it was “guaranteed” to generate “thousands of hits”:

“spam.” Jeffrey Epstein’s house manager, Juan Alessi testified that was in
daily use by the Epstein household to send and receive messages,a household to which
Defendant belonged:
Q. So when there would be a message from one of them while they were out of town,
they would call you, call you on the telephone?
A. I haven't spoken to Ghislaine in 12 years.
Q. Sorry. I'm talking about when you worked there and you would receive a message that
they were coming into town, would that be by way of telephone?
A. Telephone, and also, there was a system at the house, that it was MindSpring,
MindSpring I think it's called, that it was like a message system that would come from
the office.
Q. What is MindSpring?
A. It was a server. I think it was --the office would have, like, a message system
between him, the houses, the employees, his friends. They would write a message on the
computer. There was no email at that time.
Q. Okay. So what computer would you use?
A. My computer in my office.
Q. And so was part of your daily routine to go to your computer and check to see if you
had MindSpring messages?
A. No. That was at the end of my stay. That was the very end of my stay. I didn't get
involved with that too much. But it was a message system that Jeffrey received every
two, three hours, with all the messages that would have to go to the office in New York,
and they will print it and send it faxed to the house, and I would hand it to him.
Q. Did it look like the message pads that we've been looking at?
A. No, no, nothing like that.
Q. Was it typed-out messages?
12
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 13 of 21
A. Yes, typed-out messages.
Q. Just explain one example of how it would work. Let's say that Ghislaine wanted to
send him a message on MindSpring. How would that work?
-A. An example?
Q. Sure.
A. It got so ridiculous at the end of my stay, okay? That Mr. Epstein, instead of talking
to me that he wants a cup of coffee, he will call the office; the office would type it; they
would send it to me, Jeffrey wants a cup of coffee, or Jeffrey wants an orange juice out
by the pool.
Q. He would call the office in New York. They would then type it in MindSpring?
A. Send it to me.
Q. How would you know to check for it? How would you know to look for this
MindSpring?
A. Because I was in the office. I was there. I was there. And we have a signal when it
-come on and says, Hey, you've got mail.
Q. Okay.
A. Every day. Every day it was new things put in. That's why I left, too.
Q. Do you know who set up the mind spring system?
A. It was a computer guy. It was a computer guy who worked only for
Jeffrey. Mark. Mark Lumber.
Q. Was he local to Palm Beach?
A. No. He was in New York. Everything was set up from New York. And Mark
Lumber, I remember he came to Palm Beach to set up the system at the house.
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 223:5-225:17. (June 1, 2016) (McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7). Accordingly,
mindspring was a server set up for Jeffrey Epstein and his household to use to communicate to
one another, and was, in fact, used in this manner.

The sworn testimony of Janusz Banasiak, another of Epstein’s house managers, from the case
L.M. v. Jeffery Epstein and Sarah Kellen,1 gives a fuller representation of how Defendant, and
others in Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, used their accounts on Epstein’s mindspring server:
Q. Okay. Were you aware that Mr. Epstein used a Citrix program to link various computers?
Did you know that?
A. Yeah. I use Citrix too in my computer for exchanging e-mails and get through Internet.
***
Q. That's not something that you were, you were privy to? You weren't, you weren't in the
loop of the sharing of information in the house in terms of the computers being connected
through any server?
A. I don't really know what, how, how to answer your question because Citrix is for the
whole organization to exchange e-mail between employees.
Q. All right. You used the term?
A. So, even my computer is connected to Citrix. I can receive mail and I can e-mail
information to employee within organization. But I don't know if you can see to each
computer what is going on on another computer.
***
Q. You have used the term organization, you can share within the organization. What do you
-- just so I can understand what you're calling the organization, what do you mean by that
word?
A. People employed by Jeffrey Epstein. There are a few groups of people, his office in New
York and I guess --
***
Q. Okay. The other people mentioned as co-conspirators are Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and
Nadia Marcinkova. So we'll get to them in a minute but first just so we stay on the track of
who was in the organization, is Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova all people
-that you would also consider within the organization?
A. Yes.
Q. Okay. So, we just added three more names to it. Who else would you consider,
Ghislaine Maxwell?

II. DISCUSSION

Order.
A. Defendant’s Refusal to Even Run Ms. Giuffre’s Name as a Search
Term.
Defendant has been recalcitrant in running even the most basic searches of electronic
data. For example, in a letter sent on June 8, 2016, and in a meet and confer call on July 26,
2016, counsel for Ms. Giuffre asked Defendant to run Ms. Giuffre’s name as a search term to
find documents responsive to (for example) Ms. Giuffre’s Request No. 12, which sought
Defendant’s documents relating to Ms. Giuffre. That request was refused in writing on Friday,
July 29, 2016, at 7:02 p.m. (EST). See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, July 29, 2016, 7:02 p.m.,
Letter from Ty Gee to Ms. Schultz (refusing to run Ms. Giuffre’s name as a search term as part
of effort to identify responsive documents). Specifically, Mr. Gee’s letter said that such a search
term was inappropriate because it was “guaranteed” to generate “thousands of hits”:

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 21
In your June 8 letter, apparently acknowledging the overbreadth of the RFP,
you suggest the defendant could respond by conducting an electronic search for
plaintiff's various names-searching all documents in defendant's possession.
Setting aside that this is not what the RFP asked for, that too would entail an
extraordinary and unreasonable amount of time and money, since plaintiff's
various names are guaranteed to have thousands of hits, and someone would
have to review every hit to determine, e.g., whether the document previously
was provided to you, whether the document is not subject to production
because of privilege, or whether it was a false hit. What would be the purpose of
such an enormous expenditure of time and money? You have not said, but it
appears fairly obvious that this is fishing with a drift net. We decline your
request to engage in this exercise.
Having represented that running Ms. Giuffre’s that name was an “extraordinary and
unreasonable” task “guaranteed to have thousands of hits, and someone would have to review
every hit …” (McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1 at pg. 2 (emphasis added)), a mere three days later,
on Monday, August 1, 2016, Defendant seemingly reversed her position, and represented to the
Court that she had, in fact, run Ms. Giuffre’s names as search terms. (DE 321-6). But, contrary to
the previous claim that it would be enormously burdensome to sort through these “hits,”
Defendant now claimed that she had not found any responsive documents.
It is possible that Defendant changed her mind over the weekend and reversed course.
And, it is possible that Defendant did run those recently-contested terms over the weekend. And,
it is possible that Defendant, over the weekend, gathered a team of lawyers to review the
“thousands of hits” yielded by those terms. And, it is possible that not a single one of
Defendant’s thousands of documents bearing Ms. Giuffre’s name was relevant to this action. All
these things are possible, but none is likely.
Either way, Defendant’s refusal to even include Ms. Giuffre’s name as a search term
(either in reality or in the position she took on Friday) is evidence of Defendant’s continued bad
faith and complete avoidance of her discovery obligations. The case centers on Defendant’s
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 21
defamatory statements made about Ms. Giuffre. Obviously, Ms. Giuffre has a compelling need
to obtain Defendant’s documents about her, and she has accordingly requested Defendant’s
communications concerning her. Defendant’s documents concerning Ms. Giuffre are directly
relevant to this action, particularly because Defendant has created multiple drafts of statements to
the press defaming Ms. Giuffre.
Throughout the months of motion practice concerning these issues, and throughout all of
the meet and confers, Defendant’s counsel has never presented a case supporting the far-fetched
position that documents in the possession of the Defendant, and containing explicit references to
Ms. Giuffre, are irrelevant and not subject to discovery. Defendant’s refusal to use Ms. Giuffre’s
name as a search term, in light of Ms. Giuffre’s requests for production, and in light of the
defamation claim in this case, is so unfounded and obstructionist that it constitutes a violation of
this Court’s Order, whether or not Defendant actually engaged in the “extraordinary and
unreasonable” task of running the term over the weekend.
The refusal to run this term is particularly inappropriate in light of this Court’s order
directing the Defendant to run “mutually agreed” upon search terms. It is impossible for Ms.
Giuffre’s counsel to begin working with opposing counsel to craft appropriate search terms when
they refuse to extend minimal cooperation - first by completely ignoring Ms. Giuffre’s multiple
attempts to negotiate terms, then by ignoring the deadline to produce documents, and then by
refusal to run the most basic search term. The first term that should be run in this defamation
action - the most fundamental term - is Ms. Giuffre’s name. Defendant’s refusal to run that term
is palpably unreasonable.
Defendant’s refusal to cooperate is even more egregious given Ms. Giuffre’s extensive
efforts to provide discovery to Defendant. Ms. Giuffre has complied with Defendant’s overly-
5
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1327-19 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 21
broad discovery requests that sought documents concerning dozens of individuals, including Ms.
Giuffre’s close family members. To comply with these extraordinarily broad requests, Ms.
Giuffre ran search terms constituting the names of all these individuals. For example, Ms.
Giuffre has run the following names as search terms, including Defendant’s name, over her data:
(cid:120) Ghislaine (the defendant)
(cid:120) Maxwell (the defendant)
(c
