Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Response to Plaintiff’s Motion
to Reopen Defendant’s Deposition, and states as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff comes to this Court – for the third time – seeking to reopen the deposition of Ms.
Maxwell based on the production of two innocuous documents which she received more than
two months ago on August 16, 2016. Ms. Maxwell has twice sat for deposition, approaching 13
hours on the record, far more than the presumptive 7 hour limit under the Federal Rules. During
that time, Plaintiff has had a full and fair opportunity to depose Ms. Maxwell on the subject
matters she claims are raised by these two emails, and Plaintiff did in fact question Ms. Maxwell
on the subjects covered by the emails. Moreover, despite having access to other email
communications that are similar in nature and substance to the two email communications
Plaintiff now claims are “key” documents, Plaintiff elected to not examine Ms. Maxwell on those
similar documents for the purposes she now claims necessitate reopening the deposition. The
deposition questions Plaintiff proposes are cumulative, duplicative and Plaintiff had the
opportunity to and did obtain the information from other sources making a third deposition of
Ms. Maxwell improper.
LEGAL STANDARD
“A person who has previously been deposed in a matter may be deposed again, but only
with leave of the court.” Sentry Ins. v. Brand Mgmt. Inc., No. 10 Civ. 347, 2012 WL 3288178, at
*8 (E.D.N.Y. Aug. 10, 2012) (citing Fed.R.Civ.P. 30(a)(2)(A)(ii)). “Leave should be granted to
the extent that doing so is consistent with the factors set forth in Rule 26(b)(2), such as ‘whether
the second deposition of the witness would be unnecessarily cumulative, whether the party
requesting the deposition has had other opportunities to obtain the same information, and
whether the burden of a second deposition outweighs its potential benefit.’” Id. (quoting Ganci,

(refusing to reopen deposition where party neglected to or affirmatively opted not to inquire
about information available at prior deposition and had or could obtain the information through
other discovery devices).
Here, Plaintiff’s sole justification for an extraordinary third deposition are two irrelevant
documents that are cumulative of information previously produced, covering topics on which
Ms. Maxwell already has been deposed at length, relating to lines of inquiry covered in other
written discovery that have been fully responded to, making reopening the deposition cumulative
and duplicative. Moreover, Ms. Maxwell has offered to provide responses to specific questions
in writing (despite the fact that discovery has closed) which is the least burdensome and less
expensive means of obtaining responses to the limited inquiry proposed regarding the two
documents.
ARGUMENT
A. The Motion is Untimely
Pursuant to the Initial Scheduling Order entered in this matter, motions on discovery
issues would not be considered after the date scheduled for disclosure of expert witnesses absent
“showing of special circumstances.” See DE 13, ¶ 2. By agreement of the parties and with
approval of the court, that deadline was modified and occurred on September 8, 2016. No
special circumstances exist to permit this additional discovery, well after the close of discovery
on July 31, 2016. Plaintiff had the documents at issue in advance of September 8, 2016 and
could have moved at any time between August 16, 2016 and September 8, but chose not to do so.

denial of the motion.
B. November 2015 Communication from Mr. Gow Concerning a Press Inquiry
is Cumulative and Duplicative of Prior Discovery and Irrelevant to the
Claimed Questions
Plaintiff’s claim regarding the relevance of the Gow email is perplexing. It is a single
line email from Gow to Ms. Maxwell to which Ms. Maxwell never responded. Plaintiff correctly
points out that Ms. Maxwell’s response is not included precisely because she did not respond.
The email does not, as Plaintiff suggests, demonstrate that Ms. Maxwell was “in fact, involved
in, and consulted about, what her press agent says on her behalf.” Rather, it shows she did not
respond to an inquiry for comment.
Plaintiff’s Motion itself proves that Ms. Maxwell has already fully submitted to
numerous discovery requests concerning whether she was “involved in, and consulted about”
press communications issued by Mr. Gow, including Mr. Gow’s January 2, 2015 email to the
press that forms the basis of this lawsuit. Indeed, the question has been asked and answered in
every conceivable form of discovery under the Federal Rules. She has answered a specific
Request for Admissions on the issue, stating:
Maxwell admits that she has worked with Mr. Gow on occasion for several years
and that she has corresponded with Mr. Gow regarding communications to
members of the British press to reserve her right to seek redress for their
repetition of defamatory statements about Ms. Maxwell.
See McCawley Decl., Ex. 3, Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for Admission at 3.
Likewise, Plaintiff extensively questioned Ms. Maxwell in her depositions about her
involvement and communications with Mr. Gow regarding press inquiries, all of which makes
clear that the alleged “defamatory” statement at issue was composed by Mr. Gow and Ms.
Maxwell’s counsel Philip Barden and issued at the advice of counsel based on the requirements

of British law. This is evidenced by the deposition testimony cited by Plaintiff (McCawley
Decl., Ex. 2), as well as multiple additional pages of testimony that Plaintiff conveniently
ignores. Ms. Maxwell clearly testified on this issue during her deposition (Menninger Decl., Ex.
A at 272-274):
Q. I provided you with and I'm sorry, I don't know all the numbers, but the
statement that was issued by Ross Gow that should be a single page still in
your stack 4 of exhibits there.
MR. PAGLIUCA: Exhibit 10.
Q. Did you authorize Ross Gow to issue that statement on your behalf in January
of 2015?
A. I already testified that that was done by my lawyers.
Q. So did you authorize your lawyers to issue a statement on your behalf through
Ross Gow in January of 2015?
A. It was determined that I had to make a statement in the United Kingdom
because of the appalling lies and I just thought of some new ones. Virginia's
statement that I celebrated her 16 birthday with her. We can all agree that
that's entirely impossible. I didn't meet her until she was 17 and other lies she
perpetrated that she had a diary and we all know is a complete fake. That's
not a diary. It was just a book she was writing that you helped sell to the
press, as if it was a diary, when it was just a story that she is writing of fiction,
fictional story for money.
Q. How did you arrive at the words that were put in that statement?
MR. PAGLIUCA: I'm going to object and instruct you to the extent this calls
for any privileged communications between yourself and Mr. Barden or
another lawyer representing you, we're asserting privilege. If you can answer
that without that, feel free to answer.
Q. So what your counsel is saying, and I will exclude any privileged
communications you had with your lawyers. The question is, how did you
arrive at the words that were put in that statement, if you can tell me without
disclosing privileged communications?
A. I'm not sure that I can.
She was questioned for a third time on the same subject, again answering fully to all non-
privileged information (Menninger Decl., Ex. A at 360-363).
I will mark this as Maxwell 17.

Q. This is an email from you on January 10, 2015 to Philip Barden and Ross
Gow. The statement you had before you earlier, that, if you can pull that in
front of you, the one page press release that you gave. You might know from
memory. Was the press release that you issued with the statement about
Virginia issued in or around January 2, 2015?
A. As best as I can recollect.
Q. I want to turn your attention to the document I just handed you which is Bates
No. 001044, from you to Philip Barden and Ross Gow. It says in the first
sentence, I'm out of my depth to understand defamation, other legal hazards
and I don't want to end up in a lawsuit aimed at me from anyone, if I can help
it. Apparently, even saying Virginia is a liar has hazards. You knew at the
time you called Virginia a liar in early January of 2015 that that was
something that would result in a lawsuit, is that correct?
A. I have legal advice that I took.
Q. But you knew in early January by making a statement calling Virginia a liar
that you were subjecting yourself to a legal dispute with her?
Q. I took legal advice as to what should be said and not be said and the legal
-
advice that came from the Uni
