Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-35 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 10
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files this Motion for Leave to File a Sur-
Reply or, Alternatively, to Strike Plaintiff’s Misrepresentations of Fact from her Reply In
Support of Motion For Protective Order And To Direct The Defendant To Disclose All
Individuals To Whom Defendant Has Disseminated (sic) Confidential Information (Doc. #388),
and states as follows:
INTRODUCTION
Plaintiff’s Reply makes material misrepresentations of fact. Those misstatements cannot
stand in a filed, albeit redacted, pleading. Ms. Maxwell has never “admitted” to having
“threesomes with multiple different girls.” (Reply at 4). That is a misstatement of fact
compounded by Plaintiff’s intentional omission of the previous page of deposition testimony
which exposes the falsehood. Similarly, Detective Joe Recarey never “testified that Defendant
procured underage girls for Epstein.” (Reply at 4) To the contrary, he testified that all of the
underage girls he interviewed never mentioned Ms. Maxwell at all.
These are but a few of the misrepresentations of fact contained in Plaintiff’s Reply.
Accordingly, Ms. Maxwell seeks leave of the Court to file a Sur-Reply or, alternatively, moves
the Court to strike from Plaintiff’s Reply the misstatements of fact.
PLAINTIFF’S MISSTATEMENTS OF FACT
1. “Defendant’s own admission of how she and Epstein had threesomes with
multiple different girls whose names she can’t even remember…” (Reply at 4). Ms. Maxwell
testified that on a “few occasions” she engaged in sexual activity with Jeffrey Epstein and
another adult woman. Specifically, when asked to describe the woman, Ms. Maxwell testified:
Q. Can you describe any of the people with whom you engaged in sexual
activities at Mr. Epstein's home in Palm Beach?
A. The description that I have is somebody who is roughly my age, and I recall a
blond and I recall a brunette, and that's pretty much what I recall.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-35 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 10
(Tr. at 57:5-13).
Q. The women with whom you engaged in sexual activities with Mr. Epstein and
yourself and the other women, were they older or younger than you?
A. Same age as me.
(Tr. at 62:10-14).
It is an outright misrepresentation to this Court that Ms. Maxwell admitted to any sexual
contact with a “multiple different girls.” A “girl” is a female child. See, e.g., Cambridge
University Dictionary, “Girl: a female child or young woman, especially one still at school”
(http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/girl) (last accessed August 25, 2016). Ms.
Maxwell described these few occasions as occurring in the late 1990s when she was in her late
30s, with women who were the “same age as me.” Plaintiff well knows that it is irrelevant to
this lawsuit whether Ms. Maxwell engaged in consensual, adult sexual activities with women.
There is no allegedly defamatory statement that has anything to do with Ms. Maxwell’s private
adult sex life. It is an abuse of this litigation process to even ask Ms. Maxwell such questions.
Instead, Plaintiff’s flagrant misrepresentation is designed to support her false assertion
that Ms. Maxwell participated in sexual activities with underage girls, which she did not and
indeed, no witness other than Plaintiff has claimed that she has. Plaintiff intentionally omitted
the deposition pages from Ms. Maxwell’s testimony which clarified the age and misstated in her
Reply that she “admitted” to “threesomes with multiple girls.” This was an intentional
misrepresentation of fact.
2. “Ms. Giuffre was the child victim of sexual abuse, which is undisputed.” (Reply
at 9) If there is one thing this litigation makes clear, it is heavily disputed that Ms. Giuffre was
the child victim of sexual abuse. Ms. Maxwell has absolutely no evidence whatsoever that Ms.
Giuffre was the child victim of any sexual abuse. As she testified at her deposition:

Q. Do you know what happened during the massage appointments with Jeffrey

A. No.
Q. Were you ever present to view a massage between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia

Q. Do you ever recollect seeing them in a sexual situation?
A. I never saw them in a sexual situation.

(Tr. at 62:10-14).
It is an outright misrepresentation to this Court that Ms. Maxwell admitted to any sexual
contact with a “multiple different girls.” A “girl” is a female child. See, e.g., Cambridge
University Dictionary, “Girl: a female child or young woman, especially one still at school”

Q. Do you know what happened during the massage appointments with Jeffrey
-
Epstein and Virginia Roberts?
A. No.
Q. Were you ever present to view a massage between Jeffrey Epstein and Virginia
Roberts?
A. I don't recollect ever seeing Virginia and Jeffrey in a massage situation.
Q. Do you ever recollect seeing them in a sexual situation?
A. I never saw them in a sexual situation.
Q. Did you ever participate in sex with Virginia Roberts and Jeffrey Epstein?
A. I never ever at any single time at any point ever at all participated in anything
with Virginia and Jeffrey. And for the record, she is an absolute total liar and you
all know she lied on multiple things and that is just one other disgusting thing she
added.
(4/22/16 Tr. at 75-76). The Palm Beach State’s Attorney’s Office, the Palm Beach Police
Department and the Royal Palm Beach Police Departments all likewise have never concluded
that Plaintiff was a “child victim of sexual abuse.” Rather their reports reflect Plaintiff’s false
allegations of being a “child victim of sexual abuse” in situations such as getting in trouble for
running away from home, getting in trouble for not attending school, getting in trouble for using
-alcohol and marijuana. There is absolutely nothing “undisputed” about Plaintiff’s claim of
victimhood.
Furthermore, Plaintiff left unredacted her assertion that it is “undisputed” that Ms.
Roberts was the child victim of sexual abuse, leaving the mis-impression with the public that Ms.
Maxwell has in some way conceded that to be true. She has not.
3. “Detective Joseph Recarey … testified that Defendant procured underage girls
for Epstein” (Reply at 3, n.4). In fact, Detective Recarey testified that none of the underage girls
interviewed in connection with his investigation into Epstein claimed to have been hired by
Maxwell; in fact, none of them mentioned Ms. Maxwell at all. The two women he interviewed
who were hired by Ms. Maxwell both said they gave professional, adult massages to Epstein.

Q. So out of your entire report, the only two people who ever said anything about
Ms. Maxwell were Ms. Sjoberg, who I believe was 23 when you interviewed her?
A. Right, but she was -- She was -- she had worked there for quite some time, so
you would have to back up, I think, a year or two.
Q. She was an adult when she worked there?
A. Right. She was over the age of 18, right, let's put it that way.
Q. And she was not listed by you as a victim as part of this case, right?
A. Correct, because it was between two consenting adults.
Q. Exactly. And so that's Ms. Sjoberg, and then the other individual, I think you
said Bolero; is that right?
A. Venero, Christina Venero. She's a –
Q. Adult masseuse, correct?
A. Yes. I remember she had lots of tattoos.
Q. Tatts, right. But the 17 individuals that you listed in Exhibit 1, none of those
individuals ever said the word -- the words "Ghislaine Maxwell" during the
course of this investigation to you, correct?
A. I don't believe so. It would be on the tapes if they did.
(Tr. 194-195).
4. “Ms. Sjoberg’s testimony of how Defendant lured her from her school to have
sex with Epstein under the guise of answering phones…” (Reply at 4). In truth, Ms. Sjoberg (an
adult at the time, attending college) testified that Ms. Maxwell asked her to “massage feet,”
which is something she had recently been doing on her mission trip, that she later became a
professional masseur, that she came to engage in “consensual, adult” sexual contact with Epstein
through no involvement of Ms. Maxwell, that any sexual intercourse with Epstein took place in
2005 when Ms. Maxwell was no longer around, and that Ms. Maxwell never participated in nor
asked her to participate in any sexual conduct. (Tr. at 8, 13, 49, 50-52, 99, 101, 147).
5. “Mr. Rizzo’s testimony about how Defendant took the passport of a 15-year-old
Swedish girl and threatened her when she refused to have sex with Epstein” (Reply at 4).
Plaintiff’s continued reliance on the testimony of Mr. Rizzo is tantamount to suborning perjury.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-35 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 10
Mr. Rizzo’s testimony is vehemently denied by all individuals involved, including his former
employers,arespected medical professional and her husband a well-respected businessman. His
account does not accord with any reports made to law enforcement (Mr. Rizzo himself did not
makeany reports to law enforcement regarding the events that he says occurred 12 years ago).
Further, Mr. Rizzo said the events were so “shocking” that he quit his job,but he later admitted
he returned to the same job a short time later. Mr. Rizzo has been in litigation against his
employers and admitted he contacted Mr. Edwards to represent him hoping he could make more
money from this case.
6. “Mr. Alessi’s testimony about how Defendant brought girls over for Epstein”
(Reply at 4). In truth, Mr. Alessi testified that the massage therapists for Mr. Epstein were over
the age of 18 and that he only assisted Ms. Maxwell in hiring adult massage therapists from high
end spas such as Breakers Hotel, Mar-a-Lago, or Boca Raton Resort and Hotel. The only
underage person he saw at the house was and she was never naked or participating
in massages. (Tr. at 165, 182, 188).
7. “Mr. Figueroa’s testimony about how Defendant would cal
