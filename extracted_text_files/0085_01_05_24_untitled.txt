PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO COMPEL DATA FROM DEFENDANT’S UNDISCLOSED
EMAIL ACCOUNT AND FOR AN ADVERSE INFERENCE INSTRUCTION
Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Motion to
Compel Data from Defendant’s Undisclosed Email Account and for An Adverse Inference
Instruction regarding the data from that account, and states as follows.Defendant has not disclosed,
nor produced data from, the email account she used while abusing Ms. Giuffre from 2000-2002
in violation of this Court’s Order[DE 352]. Ms. Giuffre hereby moves to compel Defendant to
produce this data, and requests that this Court enter an adverse inference jury instruction for this
willful violation of this Court’s orders.
I. BACKGROUND
The earliest-dated email Defendant has produced in this litigation is from July 18, 2009.
(GM_00069). Ms. Giuffre is aware of two email addresses that appear to be the email addresses
Defendant used while Ms. Giuffre was with Defendant and Epstein, namely, from 2000 -2002.
Defendant has denied that she used those accounts to communicate,but she has not disclosed the
account she did useto communicate during that time, nor produce documents from it.
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-11 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 12
Importantly,Defendant has never denied using an email account for communication from
1999-2009, and the facts and circumstances show that it is exceedingly unlikely that Defendant
did not use an email account to communicatethose years.1
For example, according to United States Department of Commerce, “eighty-eight percent
of adult Internet users sent or received e-mail” in 2000. SeeEric C. Newburger, “Home
Computers and Internet Use in the United States: August 2000,” U.S.DEPARTMENT OF
COMMERCE,ECONOMICS AND STATISTICS ADMINISTRATION,U.S.CENSUS BUREAU, September
2001. Additionally, the Pew Research Center published findings thatcertain demographics have
higher internet usage, including many demographics to which Defendant belongs. For example,
higher rates of internet usage are found among younger adults (Defendant was 38in 1999); those
with college educations (Defendant has a master’s degree); those in households earnin-g more
than $75,000 (Defendant was in a household headed by a billionaire during that time, and that
household had its own private email server and account); whites or English-speaking Asian-
Americans (Defendant is white); and those who live in urban areas (Defendant lived in Palm
Beach and Manhattan). SeeAndres Perrin and Maeve Duggan, ‘Americans’ Internet Access:
2000-2015,” PEW RESEARCH CENTER, June 26, 2015.
Additionally, her boyfriend, Jeffrey Epstein, with whom she shared a household from
1999-2002 (and other years), implemented an entire, private email system to communicate with
his household and employees, including Defendant.Accordingly, given Defendant’s
extraordinary economic resources, her high-level social connections, and her elaborate
residential email/internet configurationshe hadduring that time, it is extraordinarily unlikely that
she would not employan almost ubiquitous communication tool, nor has she denied it.
1On Friday, September 23, 2016, counsel for Ms. Giuffre sent a letter to Defendant inquiring about the undisclosed
account. As of the date of this motion, Defendant has made no response.

A. The Account
Ms. Giuffre has knowledge of the account because it was lis-ted as
part of Defendant’s contact information (including phone number) on documents gatheredby the
police from Epstein’s home, and turned over to the Palm Beach County State Attorney as part of
the investigation and prosecution of Epstein.
M Ghislaine Maxwell
See(DE 280-2), Palm Beach County State Attorney’s Office, Public Records Request No.: 16-
268, Disc 7 at p. 2305 (GIUFFRE007843). Despite the fact that this account was listed as her
contact information in the home she shared with Epstein, and despite the fact that the username
bears her initials, Defendant claims she does not recognize the account, and has no access to it.
B. The Account
The mindspring account is also listed as part of Defendant’s contact information gathered
by the police. In her filing with this Court, Defendant represented that this was merely a “spam”
account “to use when registering for retail sales notifications and the like,” and that it contains no
relevant documents. (DE 345 at pg. 8). However, it appears that Jeffrey Epstein created the
mindspring.org accounts to communicate with his household and with his employees, and did, in
fact, communicate with them this way.
As previously recounted, Jeffrey Epstein’s house manager, Juan Alessi testified that
MindSpring account was in daily use by the Epstein household to send and receive messages, a
household to which Defendant belonged:
Q. So when there would be a message from one of them while they were out of town,
they would call you, call you on the telephone?
A. I haven't spok

Q. So when there would be a message from one of them while they were out of town,
they would call you, call you on the telephone?
A. I haven't spoken to Ghislaine in 12 years.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-11 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 12
Q. Sorry. I'm talking about when you worked there and you would receive a message that
they were coming into town, would that be by way of telephone?
A. Telephone, and also, there was a system at the house, that it was MindSpring,
MindSpring I think it's called, that it was like a message system that would come from
the office.
Q. What is MindSpring?
A. It was a server. I think it was --the office would have, like, a message system
between him, the houses, the employees, his friends. They would write a message on the
computer. There was no email at that time.
Q. Okay. So what computer would you use?
A. My computer in my office.
Q. And so was part of your daily routine to go to your computer and check to see if you
had MindSpring messages?
A. No. That was at the end of my stay. That was the very end of my stay. I didn't get
involved with that too much. But it was a message system that Jeffrey received every
two, three hours, with all the messages that would have to go to the office in New York,
and they will print it and send it faxed to the house, and I would hand it to him.
Q. Did it look like the message pads that we've been looking at?
A. No, no, nothing like that.
Q. Was it typed-out messages?
A. Yes, typed-out messages.
Q. Just explain one example of how it would work. Let's say that Ghislaine wanted to
send him a message on MindSpring. How would that work?
-A. An example?
Q. Sure.
A. It got so ridiculous at the end of my stay, okay? That Mr. Epstein, instead of talking
to me that he wants a cup of coffee, he will call the office; the office would type it; they
would send it to me, Jeffrey wants a cup of coffee, or Jeffrey wants an orange juice out
by the pool.
Q. He would call the office in New York. They would then type it in MindSpring?

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-11 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 12
A. Send it to me.
Q. How would you know to check for it? How would you know to look for this
MindSpring?
A. Because I was in the office. I was there. I was there. And we have a signal when it
-come on and says, Hey, you've got mail.
Q. Okay.
A. Every day. Every day it was new things put in. That's why I left, too.
Q. Do you know who set up the mind spring system?
A. It was a computer guy. It was a computer guy who worked only for
Jeffrey. Mark. Mark Lumber.
Q. Was he local to Palm Beach?
A. No. He was in New York. Everything was set up from New York. And Mark
Lumber, I remember he came to Palm Beach to set up the system at the house.
Alessi Dep. Tr. at 223:5-225:17. (June 1, 2016)(McCawley Decl. at Sealed Exhibit 1).
Accordingly, mindspring was a domain nameset up for Jeffrey Epstein and his household to
communicate withone another, and was, in fact, used in this manner.
The sworn testimony of Janusz Banasiak, another of Epstein’s house managers, from the case
L.M. v. Jeffery Epstein and Sarah Kellen,2 gives a fuller representation of how Defendant, and
others in Epstein’s sex-trafficking ring, used their accounts on Epstein’s mindspring server:
Q. Okay. Were you aware that Mr. Epstein used a Citrix program to link various computers?
Did you know that?
A. Yeah. I use Citrix too in my computer for exchanging e-mails and get through Internet.

Q. That's not something that you were, you were privy to? You weren't, you weren't in the
loop of the sharing of information in the house in terms of the computers being connected
through any server?
A. I don't really know what, how, how to answer your question because Citrix is for the
whole organization to exchange e-mail between employees.
Q. All right. You used the term?
A. So, even my computer is connected to Citrix. I can receive mail and I can e-mail
information to employee within organization. But I don't know if you can see to each
computer what is going on on another computer.
***
Q. You have used the term organization; you can share within the organization. What do you
--just so I can understand what you're calling the organization, what do you mean by that
word?
A. People employed by Jeffrey Epstein. There are a few groups of people, his office in New
York and I guess --
***
Q. Okay. The other people mentioned as co-conspirators are Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross, and
Nadia Marcinkova. So we'll get to them in a minute but first just so we stay on the track of
who was in the organization, is Sarah Kellen, Adriana Ross and Nadia Marcinkova all people
-that you would also consider within the organization?
A. Yes.
