JEFFREY EPSTEIN’S MOTION TO QUASH TRIAL SUBPOENA
Jeffrey Epstein, a non-party to the above captioned action, has been subpoenaed to testify at
the trial of this case, being commanded to appear on May 15, 2017.1 He now moves to quash that
subpoena for the reasons set forth herein.
Mr. Epstein was deposed by the parties on November 10, 2016. At that deposition, he
asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege and declined to answer all substantive questions posed to
him during the deposition. The validity of his assertion of the privilege has already been the subject
of extensive litigation in this case, with this Court ruling that, as to questions which the parties
sought to compel him to answer, Mr. Epstein’s assertion of the privilege was valid and proper.
Order, February 2, 2017 (under seal).2 Mr. Epstein’s good faith basis for his assertion of his Fifth
Amendment privilege remains unabated. As plaintiff is well aware, it is Mr. Epstein’s intention, if
he is called as a witness at the trial of this case, to once again assert his Fifth Amendment privilege
1 Mr. Epstein agreed to have his attorney accept service of the subpoena but, in so doing,
reserved his rights to move to quash the subpoena on any and all grounds.
2 As to other questions that the parties sought to compel Mr. Epstein to answer, the Court
concluded that the information sought was irrelevant. Id. at 13. The upshot of the Court’s ruling was
that Mr. Epstein was not required to answer any of the questions to which the parties sought to
compel his answers.

in response to questioning, and his assertion of the privilege at trial will be no less valid than it was
at his deposition. Under the circumstances of this case, this Court should not require Mr. Epstein to
physically appear to assert his Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury.
While it may be true that there is no blanket prohibition in all civil cases against calling a
witness who will assert his Fifth Amendment privilege, see, e.g., Brinks, Inc. v. City of New York,
717 F.2d 700, 708-10 (2d Cir. 1983); see also LiButti v. United States, 107 F.3d 110 (2d Cir. 1997),
neither is it the rule that it should be permitted in all such cases. Instead, the propriety of requiring
a witness to appear at trial to invoke his Fifth Amendment rights in front of a jury must be evaluated
on a case-by-case basis. “The trial judge maintains discretion under Fed. R. Evid. 403 to control the
way in which non-party claims of privilege reach the jury.” RAD Servs., Inc. v. Aetna Cas. & Sur.
Co., 808 F.2d 271, 272 (3d Cir. 1986), quoted in LiButti, 107 F.3d at 122. See Evans v. City of
Chicago, 513 F.3d 735, 740-41 (7th Cir. 2008)(finding no abuse of discretion in district court’s
refusal to permit plaintiff to “maximize and dramatize the moment” by calling witness to assert Fifth
Amendment privilege in front of jury); see also Brinks, 717 F.2d at 715 (Winter, J.,
dissenting)(decrying the “invitation to sharp practice” inherent in “permitting the systematic
interrogation of witnesses on direct examination by counsel who knows they will assert the privilege
against self-incrimination”).
Here, Mr. Epstein submitted to deposition under oath and recorded on video. At that
deposition, the parties had an unlimited opportunity to examine him at length, asking approximately
600 separate questions, to all of which Mr. Epstein asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege. No
different result would obtain were Mr. Epstein forced to take the stand and assert his Fifth
Amendment privilege in front of the jury. Plaintiff seeks to call Mr. Epstein as a witness in the hope

not of eliciting substantive testimony but of obtaining adverse inferences against defendant Maxwell
based on Mr. Epstein’s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to various questions.
Whether or not such adverse inferences are appropriate under the circumstances of this case is
currently being litigated between the parties and will be decided by this Court. As explained below,
requiring Mr. Epstein to appear before a jury to answer the very same questions as to which he has
already asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege during sworn video-recorded testimony will add
nothing to the ultimate issue of whether any adverse inference should be permitted, nor would it
make any potential adverse inference any more or less valid.
The Second Circuit has identified four factors which are relevant to the determination as to
whether courts should permit juries to draw adverse inferences against a party based on a witness’
invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege:

nature of the relationship will invariably be the most significant circumstance. It should be

not of eliciting substantive testimony but of obtaining adverse inferences against defendant Maxwell
based on Mr. Epstein’s assertion of the Fifth Amendment privilege with respect to various questions.
Whether or not such adverse inferences are appropriate under the circumstances of this case is
currently being litigated between the parties and will be decided by this Court. As explained below,
requiring Mr. Epstein to appear before a jury to answer the very same questions as to which he has
already asserted his Fifth Amendment privilege during sworn video-recorded testimony will add
nothing to the ultimate issue of whether any adverse inference should be permitted, nor would it
make any potential adverse inference any more or less valid.
The Second Circuit has identified four factors which are relevant to the determination as to
whether courts should permit juries to draw adverse inferences against a party based on a witness’
invocation of his Fifth Amendment privilege:
1. The Nature of the Relevant Relationships: While no particular relationship governs, the
nature of the relationship will invariably be the most significant circumstance. It should be
examined, however, from the perspective of a non-party witness' loyalty to the plaintiff or
defendant, as the case may be. The closer the bond, whether by reason of blood, friendship
or business, the less likely the non-party witness would be to render testimony in order to
damage the relationship.
2. The Degree of Control of the Party Over the Non-Party Witness: The degree of control
which the party has vested in the non-party witness in regard to the key facts and general
subject matter of the litigation will likely inform the trial court whether the assertion of the
privilege should be viewed as akin to testimony approaching admissibility under Fed. R.
Evid. 801(d)(2), and may accordingly be viewed, as in Brink's, as a vicarious admission.
3. The Compatibility of the Interests of the Party and Non-Party Witness in the Outcome of
the Litigation: The trial court should evaluate whether the non-party witness is pragmatically
a noncaptioned party in interest and whether the assertion of the privilege advances the
interests of both the non-party witness and the affected party in the outcome of the litigation.
4. The Role of the Non-Party Witness in the Litigation: Whether the non-party witness was
a key figure in the litigation and played a controlling role in respect to any of its underlying
aspects also logically merits consideration by the trial court.

LiButti, 107 F.3d at 123-24 (italics in original). In her motion seeking to present Mr. Epstein’s
assertions of his Fifth Amendment privilege in response to various questions, plaintiff has argued
why these factors should result in adverse inferences against defendant Maxwell, see Plaintiff
Giuffre’s Motion to Present Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein for Purposes of Obtaining an Adverse
Inference (“Motion to Present Epstein Testimony”) at 10-13, and defendant Maxwell has argued why
they should not, see Defendant’s Response in Opposition to Plaintiff Giuffre’s Motion to Present
Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein for Purposes of Obtaining an Adverse Inference (“Opposition to
Motion to Present Epstein Testimony”) at 2-11. Requiring Mr. Epstein to appear personally to assert
his Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury has no potential whatsoever to add to or detract
from either plaintiff’s arguments in favor of an adverse inference or arguments in opposition
presented by defendant Maxwell. These factors all present questions which can be determined
entirely independently of Mr. Epstein’s appearance as a witness at trial. Plaintiff appears to recognize
as much, as she makes no distinction in her motion between live testimony and deposition testimony;
indeed, plaintiff indicates in her motion that, if Mr. Epstein were to appear as a witness, she would
put the very same questions to him as she did at his deposition. See id. at 4 (“Ms. Giuffre now
intends to call Epstein to ask him these same questions, either live an in-person if he honors a trial
subpoena served on his legal counsel, or, if he fails to appear, via deposition testimony such as the
designations just discussed” (emphasis added)). Indeed, in LiButti itself, the issue was the
admissibility of the witness’ deposition testimony and the extent to which, if any, adverse inference
inferences should be drawn from the witness’ invocation of the Fifth Amendment at his deposition.
Nothing will be added to the adverse inference inquiry by requiring Mr. Epstein to appear personally
and reassert his Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury, nor would the jury be aided in

determining whether to draw any adverse inferences it is permitted to consider by seeing Mr. Epstein
assert the privilege in live testimony in front of it, rather than by seeing him do the same thing in his
video deposition.
Adverse inference issues are often submitted to the jury based on deposition testimony rather
than on live invocation of the privilege in front of the jury, see, e.g., SEC v. Jasper, 678 F.3d 1116,
1125 (9th Cir. 2012); RAD, 808 F.2d at 272; Data Gen. Corp. v. Grumman Sys. Support Corp., 825
F. Supp. 340, 352 (D. Mass. 1993); East Coast Novelty Co. v. City of New York, 842 F. Supp. 117,
121 (S.D.N.Y. 1994); Penfield v. Venuti, 589 F. Supp. 250, 255-56 (D.Conn. 1984), and, should this
Court determine that the jury may consider whether an adverse inference is appropriate with respect
to any particular questions asked of Mr. Epstein, then the use of Mr. Epstein’s video deposition
testimony is the procedure which should be followed in this case.
While requiring Mr. Epstein to invoke his Fifth Amendment privilege in front of the jury will
yield not even a marginal benefit to either party, there are substantial countervailing conc
