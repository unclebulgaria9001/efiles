JANE DOE #3 AND JANE DOE #4’S MOTION PURSUANT TO RULE 21 FOR
JOINDER IN ACTION
COME NOW Jane Doe #3 and Jane Doe #4 (also referred to as “the new victims”), by and
through undersigned counsel, to file this motion pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 21
to join this action, on the condition that they not re-litigate any issues already litigated by Jane
Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 (also referred to as “the current victims”). The new victims have
suffered the same violations of their rights under the Crime Victims’ Rights Act (CVRA) as the
current victims. Accordingly, they desire to join in this action to vindicate their rights as well.
Because the new victims will not re-litigate any issues previously litigated by the current victims
(and because they are represented by the same legal counsel as the current victims), the
Government will not be prejudiced if the Court grants the motion. The Court may “at any time”
add new parties to the action, Fed. R. Civ. P. 21. Accordingly, the Court should grant the
motion.1

FACTUAL BACKGROUND
As the Court is aware, more than six years ago, Jane Doe #1 filed the present action
against the Government, alleging a violation of her rights under the CVRA, 18 U.S.C. § 3771.
DE1. She alleged that Jeffrey Epstein had sexually abused her and that the United States had
entered into a secret non-prosecution agreement (NPA) regarding those crimes in violation of her
rights. At the first court hearing on the case, the Court allowed Jane Doe #2 to also join the
action. Both Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 specifically argued that the government had failed to
protect their CVRA rights (inter alia) to confer, to reasonable notice, and to be treated with
fairness. In response, the Government argued that the CVRA rights did not apply to Jane Doe #1
and Jane Doe #2 because nofederal charges had ever been filed against Jeffrey Epstein.
The Court has firmly rejected the United States’ position. In a detailed ruling, the Court
concluded that the CVRA extended rights to Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2 even though federal
charges were never filed. DE 189. The Court explained that because the NPA barred
prosecution of crimes committed against them by Epstein, they had “standing” to assert
violations of the CVRA rights. Id. The Court deferred ruling on whether the two victims would
be entitled to relief, pending development of a fuller evidentiary record. Id.
Two other victims, who are in many respects similarly situated to the current victims,
now wish to join this action. The new victims joining at this stage will not cause any delay and
their joinder in this case is the most expeditious manner in which to pursue their rights. Because
the background regarding their abuse is relevant to the Court’s assessment of whether to allow
them to join, their circumstances are recounted here briefly.
fashion. Counsel for the new victims have made their true identities known to the Government.

Jane Doe #3’s Circumstances
As with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, Jane Doe #3 was repeatedly sexually abused by
Epstein. The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane
Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA. If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe #3
would prove the following:
In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women
whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator
in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became known to the government that
Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane
Doe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein’s
mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators
coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doe #3
began giving Epstein a “massage,” Epstein and Maxwell turned it into a sexual encounter, as
they had done with many other victims. Epstein then became enamored with Jane Doe #3, and
with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”
Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to
escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From
1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm
Beach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U

Jane Doe #3’s Circumstances
As with Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2, Jane Doe #3 was repeatedly sexually abused by
Epstein. The Government then concealed from Jane Doe #3 the existence of its NPA from Jane
Doe #3, in violation of her rights under the CVRA. If allowed to join this action, Jane Doe #3
would prove the following:
In 1999, Jane Doe #3 was approached by Ghislaine Maxwell, one of the main women
whom Epstein used to procure under-aged girls for sexual activities and a primary co-conspirator
in his sexual abuse and sex trafficking scheme. In fact, it became known to the government that
Maxwell herself regularly participated in Epstein’s sexual exploitation of minors, including Jane
Doe #3. Maxwell persuaded Jane Doe #3 (who was then fifteen years old) to come to Epstein’s
mansion in a fashion very similar to the manner in which Epstein and his other co-conspirators
coerced dozens of other children (including Jane Doe #1 and Jane Doe #2). When Jane Doe #3

with the assistance of Maxwell converted her into what is commonly referred to as a “sex slave.”
Epstein kept Jane Doe #3 as his sex slave from about 1999 through 2002, when she managed to
escape to a foreign country and hide out from Epstein and his co-conspirators for years. From
1999 through 2002, Epstein frequently sexually abused Jane Doe #3, not only in West Palm
Beach, but also in New York, New Mexico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, in international airspace on
his Epstein’s private planes, and elsewhere.
Epstein also sexually trafficked the then-minor Jane Doe, making her available for sex to
politically-connected and financially-powerful people. Epstein’s purposes in “lending” Jane Doe

(along with other young girls) to such powerful people were to ingratiate himself with them for
business, personal, political, and financial gain, as well as to obtain potential blackmail
information.
One such powerful individual that Epstein forced then-minor Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with was former Harvard Law Professor Alan Dershowitz, a close friend of Epstein’s
and well-known criminal defense attorney. Epstein required Jane Doe #3 to have sexual
relations with Dershowitz on numerous occasions while she was a minor, not only in Florida but
also on private planes, in New York, New Mexico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands. In addition to
being a participant in the abuse of Jane Doe #3 and other minors, Deshowitz was an eye-witness
to the sexual abuse of many other minors by Epstein and several of Epstein’s co-conspirators.
Dershowitz would later play a significant role in negotiating the NPA on Epstein’s behalf.
Indeed, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement that provided immunity from federal
prosecution in the Southern District of Florida not only to Epstein, but also to “any potential co-
conspirators of Epstein.” NPA at 5. Thus, Dershowitz helped negotiate an agreement with a
provision that provided protection for himself against criminal prosecution in Florida for
sexually abusing Jane Doe #3. Because this broad immunity would have been controversial if
disclosed, Dershowitz (along with other members of Epstein’s defense team) and the
Government tried to keep the immunity provision secret from all of Epstein’s victims and the
general public, even though such secrecy violated the Crime Victims’ Rights Act.
Ghislaine Maxwell was another person in Epstein’s inner circle and a co-conspirator in
Epstein’s sexual abuse. She was someone who consequently also appreciated the immunity
granted by the NPA for the crimes she committed in Florida. In addition to participating in the

sexual abuse of Jane Doe #3 and others, Maxwell also took numerous sexually explicit pictures
of underage girls involved in sexual activities, including Jane Doe #3. She shared these
photographs (which constituted child pornography under applicable federal laws) with Epstein.
The Government is apparently aware of, and in certain instances possesses some of these
photographs.
Perhaps even more important to her role in Epstein’s sexual abuse ring, Maxwell had
direct connections to other powerful individuals with whom she could connect Epstein. For
instance, one such powerful individual Epstein forced Jane Doe #3 to have sexual relations with
was a member of the British Royal Family, Prince Andrew (a/k/a Duke of York). Jane Doe #3
was forced to have sexual relations with this Prince when she was a minor in three separate
geographical locations: in London (at Ghislaine Maxwell’s apartment), in New York, and on
Epstein’s private island in the U.S. Virgin Islands (in an orgy with numerous other under-aged
girls). Epstein instructed Jane Doe #3 that she was to give the Prince whatever he demanded and
required Jane Doe #3 to report back to him on the details of the sexual abuse. Maxwell
facilitated Prince Andrew’s acts of sexual abuse by acting as a “madame” for Epstein, thereby
assisting in internationally trafficking Jane Doe #3 (and numerous other young girls) for sexual
purposes.
Another person in Epstein’s inner circle of friends (who becomes apparent with almost
no investigative effort) is Jean Luc Brunel. Epstein sexually trafficked Jane Doe #3 to Jean Luc
Brunel many times. Brunel was another of Epstein’s closest friends and a regular traveling
companion, who had many contacts with young girls throughout the world. Brunel has been a
model scout for various modeling agencies for many years and apparently was able to get U.S.
