PLAINTIFF’S RESPONSE IN OPPOSITION TO DEFENDANT’S MOTION FOR
PROTECTIVE ORDER REGARDING FINANCIAL INFORMATION
Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Response in
Opposition to Defendant’s Motion for a Protective Order Regarding Financial Information (DE
370). Defendant’s financial information is highly relevant to this case, particularly in light of
Ms. Giuffre’s punitive damages claim as well as press reports suggesting that the Defendant may
be selling her assets in New York and transferring the money outside the jurisdiction.
Accordingly, Defendant’s motion for a protective order should be denied.1
I. PRELIMINARY STATEMENT
As recounted by Defendant (DE 370 at 1-3), Ms. Giuffre has served discovery requests
on Defendant, seeking certain financial information from the Defendant. The requests are
narrowly tailored to the time frame related to this case, as the requested information concerns
1 Contemporaneous with the filing of this response to Defendant’s motion for a protective order
regarding financial information, Ms. Giuffre has also filed a motion to compel Defendant to
produce the requested financial information. This parallel filing is apparently required because
Ms. Giuffre does not simply seek the negative relief of denial of Defendant’s requested
protective order but also the affirmative relief of a Court order requiring production of the
materials.

financial information from just the time during which Defendant has defamed Ms. Giuffre (2015
to present).
As with most of the other discovery requests she has received, Defendant has chosen not
to produce any information. Instead, she has filed this motion for a blanket protective order,
arguing that financial discovery has no relevance whatsoever to any issue in this case. Of course,
given the broad scope of discovery, the Court can grant Defendant’s motion only if no relevance
exists at all. But in fact, Defendant’s financial information is highly relevant to at least three
issues in this case. First, Defendant’s recent efforts to conceal assets from the reach of this Court
proves consciousness of her guilt of sex trafficking. Second, Defendant’s financial affairs will
show dependence on Epstein for financial support, an issue highly relevant to motive.2 Third, as
Defendant herself appears to admit, the discovery is relevant to the size of the punitive damage
award that the jury should enter in this case. Facts relevant to each of these three points are set
out in order below.
A. Discovery of Financial Information is Relevant to Show Defendant’s
Transfer of Assets Out of the Jurisdiction after the Commencement of
Litigation and thus Her Consciousness of Guilt.
The requested financial information is relevant to issues relating to Defendant’s apparent
attempt to conceal assets from the Court. The timing of recent events is telling here. As the
Court will recall, in court pleadings filed December 30, 2014, Ms. Giuffre initially publicly
alleged Defendant had sexually abused her. On September 21, 2015, Ms. Giuffre filed her
lawsuit against Defendant here in the Southern District of New York. (DE 1.) Ms. Giuffre is
seeking at least $50 million in compensatory and punitive damages from Ms. Maxwell. Just a
few months after the suit was filed, on April 28, 2016, the New York Post reported that

Beach. Bates Number SAO FOIA disc 7 (bates Giuffre 007590) at p. 93-95.

Defendant, “the daughter of the late disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, has sold her
townhouse at 116 E. 65th St. for $15 million.” See http://nypost.com/2016/04/28/alleged-epstein-
madam-sells-16m-manhattan-townhouse/. When questioned about the sale, Defendant’s
representative refused to comment. See id. (broker Shari Scharfer Rollins, of Douglas Elliman,
did not return calls).
The transfers of assets, likely out of the jurisdiction of this Court, provides evidence of
consciousness of criminal guilt and civil liability. Clearly, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to explore all
the circumstances surrounding the timing and consummation of this sale, including whether
Defendant has now secreted these assets someplace where they may be difficult to reach, such as
in the United Kingdom (where, on information and belief, Maxwell is a UK citizen holding a UK
passport) or elsewhere.
Maxwell’s removal and apparent concealment of assets takes place against a backdrop of
disregard of court orders by Maxwell and others involved in the Epstein sex trafficking
organization. In 2009, before suit was ever filed in this case, Maxwell was served with a
subpoena for a deposition in a civil case against Jeffrey Epstein. After extensive discussion and
coordinating a convenient time and place, as well as ultimately agreeing to a confidentiality
agreement prep

Defendant, “the daughter of the late disgraced press baron Robert Maxwell, has sold her
townhouse at 116 E. 65th St. for $15 million.” See http://nypost.com/2016/04/28/alleged-epstein-

The transfers of assets, likely out of the jurisdiction of this Court, provides evidence of
consciousness of criminal guilt and civil liability. Clearly, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to explore all
the circumstances surrounding the timing and consummation of this sale, including whether
Defendant has now secreted these assets someplace where they may be difficult to reach, such as
in the United Kingdom (where, on information and belief, Maxwell is a UK citizen holding a UK
passport) or elsewhere.
Maxwell’s removal and apparent concealment of assets takes place against a backdrop of
disregard of court orders by Maxwell and others involved in the Epstein sex trafficking
organization. In 2009, before suit was ever filed in this case, Maxwell was served with a
subpoena for a deposition in a civil case against Jeffrey Epstein. After extensive discussion and
coordinating a convenient time and place, as well as ultimately agreeing to a confidentiality
agreement prepared by Maxwell’s attorney, at the eleventh hour Maxwell’s attorney informed
plaintiff’s counsel that Maxwell’s mother was very ill and that consequently Maxwell was
leaving the country with no plans to return. The deposition was cancelled. Yet a short time later,
Maxwell was photographed at Chelsea Clinton’s wedding in Rhinebeck, New York, confirming
the suspicion that she was indeed still in the country and willing to say anything to avoid her
deposition.
Similarly, the Court is familiar with the long (and still on-going) effort of Ms. Giuffre’s
efforts to take the depositions of those who participated with Defendant in sexual abuse --

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-23 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 22
including Jeffrey Epstein, Nadia Marcikova, and Sarah Kellen – depositions that have thus far
been defeated by evasions of service of process and other similar maneuvers. See DE 160,
Motion for Leave to Serve Three Deposition Subpoenas by Means Other than Personal Service,
which this Court granted on June 20, 2016; DE 308, Motion for Finding Civil Contempt against
Sarah Kellen for Ignoring Subpoena (pending); DE 310, Motion for Finding of Civil Contempt
against Nadia Marcinkova for Ignoring Subpoena (pending). Similarly, the Court will recall that
Ms. Giuffre was recently forced to resort to the Hague Convention in an effort to depose
Maxwell’s spokesman, Ross Gow, about statements he made on Defendant’s behalf. See DE
306, Motion for Extension of Time to Complete Discovery to Serve and Depose Ross Gow
(pending); DE 330 and 331, Application for Letters Rogatory (application granted and letter
issued by the Court on August 11, 2016 (DE 358)).
Against the backdrop of these repeated evasion efforts, Defendant’s sale of $15 million in
assets appears even more alarming. And, evidence of consciousness of guilt is admissible in
criminal cases, even where the standard of proof is much higher than in a civil case. See, e.g.,
United States v. Amuso, 21 F.3d 1251, 1258 (2d Cir. 1994) (recognizing admissibility of
evidence from which a jury could find consciousness of guilt). Ms. Giuffre it entitled to explore
all the circumstances surrounding Ms. Maxwell’s apparent efforts to hide assets.3
B. Discovery of Financial Information is Relevant to Show a Financial Link to
Epstein.
In addition to providing evidence Defendant is hiding assets, the financial information
will help to establish an important link between Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein. Drawing again
3 The Court should review Defendant’s reply to this pleading carefully to see if she represents to
the Court that the $15 million in assets she has apparently concealed will be made available to
satisfy any judgment that Ms. Giuffre might obtain in this case. If Defendant fails to make such
a representation, the Court can draw the obvious inference that Defendant is attempting to hide
her assets to escape responsibility for paying any ultimate judgment here.

on a published article from the New York Post, it appears that Defendant’s townhouse (among
other assets) might be part of a covert payoff from Epstein to Defendant. As the Post reports,
“[a] lawyer with links to Epstein reportedly bought the townhouse for Maxwell, who has
allegedly never earned enough or inherited enough to make the purchase on her own.”
http://nypost.com/2016/04/28/alleged-epstein-madam-sells-16m-manhattan-townhouse/. This
article suggests that Defendant is reliant upon Epstein for tremendous financial support, which
certainly provides a strong motive for her to provide favors to Epstein – including providing him
with underage girls for sex. It also provides a strong motive for her to lie at trial about Epstein’s
(and her own) sex trafficking. Indeed, to conceal these facts, other media reports suggest that
the reason that Defendant was trying to sell her townhouse “quietly” was perhaps “to put some
distance between herself and Epstein, who owns a mansion a few blocks away.”
http://pagesix.com/2015/02/02/accused-epstein-madam-quietly-selling-ues-townhouse/.
Again, perhaps there is some innocent explanation for these secretive efforts. But, if so,
Defendant has declined to provide it. See id. (noting Defendant’s “rep didn’t comment”).
C. Discovery of Financial Information is Relevant to the Issue of the Size of any
Punitive Damages.
Financial information regarding Defendant is also highly relevant to Ms. Giuffre’s
punitive damages claim. Of course, it is well-settled law that “evidence of a tortfeasor’s wealth
is traditionally admissible as a measure of the amount of punitive damages that should be
awarded.” City of Newport v. Fact Concerts, Inc., 453 U.S. 247, 270 (1981). As expla
