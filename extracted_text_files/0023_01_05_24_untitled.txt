Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre (“Ms. Giuffre”), by and through her undersigned counsel,
hereby files this Reply in Support of her Motion to Compel (DE 345).
I. ARGUMENT
A. This Court should Order Production of Documents Responsive to Requests
Nos. 1-3
Defendant characterizes the police reports (and information therein)concerning Ms.
Giuffre as a minor asboth“highly relevant” (Br. at 4) and “irrelevant” to this action (Br. at 5).
On page 4, Defendant claims that actual police reports are “highly relevant,” stating: “the
publicly available, redacted police reports are part of the record and constitute highly relevant
evidence in this action.” But, on the very next page, when discussing the information gleaned
from those police reports that Mr. Pagliuca had prior to the conferral call, Defendant claims the
information from the police reports is “irrelevant,” stating:“The records requested are
irrelevant. Plaintiff has asserted a single claim for defamation based on Ms. Maxwell’s denial of her
outrageous allegations of ‘sex trafficking.’The dispositive question is whether the denial was
defamatory. RFP No. 1 seeks documents Mr. Pagliuca allegedly ‘reviewed and/or relied upon’in
allegedly making statements stating that Plaintiff previously made false accusations of sexual
assault.” (Br. at 5). (Emphasis original).
How Defendant purports to distinguish between the actual police reports as “relevant,” and
the information contained in the police reports as “irrelevant,” is unexplained. However, logic would
dictate that if the police reports are “relevant,” so, too, is the information contained therein and how
itwas acquired. For that reason, this Court should grant Ms. Giuffre’srequests Nos .1-3.
Defendant states that the material responsive to Ms. Giuffre’s requests Nos. 2-3 constitute
“privileged communications between (a) Ms. Maxwell’s attorneys and Ms. Maxwell, (b) defense
counsel and their agents, and between (c) defense counsel with joint defense or common interest
privileges concerning obtaining or receiving 'local police[] findings or opinions’ and ‘statements
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-31 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 13
made by law enforcement or any state attorney.’” (Br. at 9). Ms. Giuffre understands this winding
sentence to mean that documents responsive to Requests Nos. 2-3 constitute communications
between Defendant and Jeffrey Epstein and Alan Dershowitz or their counsel. As discussed at length
in the moving brief, Defendant bears the burden to show that there is a joint defense agreement
among them, but she refuses to disclose the joint defense agreement, and this Court, months ago, has
already ordered Defendant to turn over her communications with Epstein and Dershowitz that she
purported were privileged. (See April 15, 2016Order). Accordingly, this Court should grant Ms.
Giuffre’s requests Nos. 2-3.
B. This Court should Order Production of Documents Responsive to Requests
Nos. 6-7; 9-10; and 11.
These requests concern joint defense agreements between and among Defendant, Epstein,
and Dershowitz,and communications among counsel for Defendant and Epstein and Dershowitz.
In Defendant’s objections submitted to Ms. Giuffre in responseto the request for the joint
defense agreement between her and Dershowitz, she stated that she “has been unable to locate
any documents responsive to this Request.” In her brief, she says that “there is no joint defense
agreement to produce.” (Br. at 9). There are two problems with this position.
First, Defendant is withholding responsive documents consisting of communications
between Dershowitz/Dershowitz’s counsel and Epstein/Epstein’s counsel. Defendant does not,
and cannot, refute the case law that puts the burden on establishing a joint defense privilege
applies on the party claiming it, which must be shown through evidence. Defendant has put forth
no evidence of these agreements. In fact, Defendant states that no such agreement exists with
Dershowitz, and she is refusing to reveal the agreement with Epstein. Even if any privileges
apply to the actual joint defense agreement with Epstein (and, in many cases, Courts find no
privilege applies whatsoever), Defendant has to make that showing. This response brief does not

make that showing. “Such showings must be based on competent evidence, usually through
affidavits, deposition testimony, or other admissible evidence.” Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290

made by law enforcement or any state attorney.’” (Br. at 9). Ms. Giuffre understands this winding

make that showing. “Such showings must be based on competent evidence, usually through
affidavits, deposition testimony, or other admissible evidence.” Egiazaryan v. Zalmayev, 290
F.R.D. 421, 428 (S.D.N.Y. 2013) (citations omitted). Defendant has put forth no affidavits or
testimony, but, instead, filed declarations of counsel for Epstein and Dershowitz, indicating their
“belief”that a common interest exists.1 Should the Court consider these declarations to be
“competent evidence” to establish that a joint defense agreement exists between Defendant and
Dershowitz and Epstein (though neither declaration state that an agreement exists), Ms. Giuffre
submits that it should not have taken motion practice to elicit such “evidence” as it is
Defendant’s burden to produce this evidence.
Second, these agreements are plainlyrelevant to thedefamationclaim in this case. This
Court has previously ordered Defendant to produce emails in which both Epstein and Dershowitz
were active in assisting Defendant draft defamatory statements against Ms. Giuffre. See April 15,
2016 Order. Defendant has set forth the defense that her defamatory statements are “substantially
true,” and “cannot realistically have cause impairment to Plaintiff’s reputation.” The emails
between and among Defendant, Epstein, and Dershowitz, show that that the three of them
conspired specifically to damage Ms. Giuffre’s reputation. They also reveal that Defendant’s
defamatory statements are not “substantially true.” The joint defense agreement(s) show
Defendant’s ongoing and continued relationship with Dershowitz and Epstein, which is relevant
to her defenses. Both of these individuals had a hand in Defendant’s statements to the public. At
the very least, the Court should conduct an in camerareview of any joint defense agreements
that exist to determine their relevanceto both the defamation claim and the multiple affirmative
defenses offered by Defendant. SeeSteuben Foods, Inc. v. GEA Process Engineering, Inc., 2016
1 Strangely, Defendant redacted both the names of counsel and the names of Epstein and
Dershowitz in these filings.

WL 1238785, at *2 (W.D.N.Y., 2016) (granting Plaintiff’s motion to compel production of
paragraph 5 of defendant’s joint defense agreement, since that paragraph is relevant to the claims
and defenses).
C. This Court should Order Production of Documents Responsive to Requests
No 12.
In this request, Ms. Giuffre seeks the documents that concern her. Defendant tells the
Court, “[c]conspicuously missing is any explanation of why a request for ‘all documents
concerning’ Plaintiff would not require review and production of every document the defense
has in this case.” (Br. at 14). Both common sense and common attorney competencies belies this
statement.2 First, it is expected that the overwhelming majority of documents “concerning” Ms.
Giuffre are attorney-client communications or work product created after the filing of this
lawsuit. Such documents do not evenrequireextensive review as they are protected by privilege,
and can be categorically logged pursuant to the Local Rules and governing case law.3 Therefore,
there is no merit to Defendant’s burden claim.
Moreover, throughout the months of motion practice concerning these issues, and
throughout all of the meet and confers, Defendant’s counsel has never presented a case
supporting the far-fetched position that non-privileged documents in the possession of the
2 Furthermore, Ms. Giuffre’s correspondence suggesting just how these documents can be
collected electronically without undue burden also belies any claim of ignorance on how to
collect and produce documents responsive to this request without reviewing “thousands” of
presumptively privileged communications.

v. Aereo, Inc., 2013 WL 139560, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Jan. 11, 2013) (“the Court notes that [parties] .
. . are presented with a number of option that . . . could mitigate the burden . . . including . . .
exclusion from the privilege logs of documents created after the commencement of litigation . .
..”) (Emphasis added); United States v. Bouchard Transp., 2010 WL 1529248, at *2 (E.D.N.Y.
Apr. 14, 2010) (“First, privilege logs are commonly limited to documents created before the date
litigation was initiated. This is due to the fact that, in many situations, it can be assumed that all
documents created after charges have been brought or a lawsuit has been filed and withheld
on the grounds of privilege were created “because of” that pending litigation.”) (Emphasis
added).

What should be reviewed and produced are the documents in Defendant’s possession
concerning Ms. Giuffre that are outside the scope of privilege.This would include, for example,
Defendant’s communications with third parties that concern Ms. Giuffre. The Court has already
