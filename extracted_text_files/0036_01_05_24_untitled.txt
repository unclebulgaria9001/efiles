Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-16 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 10
Defendant Ghislaine Maxwell (“Ms. Maxwell”) files her Reply in Support of the Motion
in Limine to Exclude In Toto certain depositions designated by Plaintiff for use at trial and states
as follows:
I. PLAINTIFF CANNOT SATSIFY THE LEGAL REQUIREMENTS FOR USE OF
CERTAIN DEPOSITIONS AT TRIAL
A. Jeffrey Epstein and Ronald Rizzo Are Not Unavailable
Plaintiff cannot claim that Jeffery Epstein and Ronald Rizzo are “unavailable witnesses”
whose testimony can be presented by deposition at trial under Rule 34 of the Federal Rules of
Civil Procedure. She admits she simply had not, prior to designating testimony, even attempted
to serve these witnesses or obtain their attendance at trial. She has now obtained an agreement to
accept service by Mr. Epstein’s counsel, mooting any claim that he is unavailable.1 With respect
to Mr. Rizzo, she concedes he resides within 100 miles of the courthouse, and provides no basis
to claim that he cannot be served. Based on these confessions, the Motion in Limine to exclude
the use of the designated portions of these depositions in toto must be granted.
B. As a Retained Expert, Phillip Esplin Cannot Be Deemed Unavailable
Plaintiff’s argument concerning Phillip Esplin fails to acknowledge or even address the
cases cited that requirethat prior to being permitted to use prior sworn testimony of an expert
witness she must carry the affirmative burden on proving: 1) Plaintiff “attempt[ed] to secure the
voluntary [trial] attendance of a witness who lives beyond the subpoena power of the court” and
2) that no similar expert is available. Carter-Wallace, Inc. v. Otte, 474 F.2d 529, 536 (2d Cir.
1972). Plaintiff cannot carry this burden, requiring that the Motion in Limine be granted.
1 Issues concerning if Mr. Epstein should be required to appear to invoke this fifth amendment rights will
be addressed in Response to Plaintiff's Motion to Present Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein for Purposes of Obtaining
an Adverse Inference.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-16 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 10
Plaintiff’s misplaced argument that Ms. Maxwell is somehow required to make Dr.
Esplin available at trial violates the fundamental rules of trial and the requirements for rebuttal
witnesses. Of course, at this point, Ms. Maxwell does not know information Plaintiff may
present in her case-in-chief. Ms. Maxwell has filed well-founded motions in limineto exclude
the testimony of both Dr. Kliman and Professor Coonan prohibiting from providing their
credibility and vouching opinions. This is the subject matter of Dr. Esplin’s rebuttal report
which explains that there is no reliable or scientific methodology by which an expert could
reliably come to such opinions. Of course, if the improper testimony by Dr. Kliman and
Professor Coonan is excluded, as it should be, there will be nothing for Dr. Esplin to “rebut” and
he will not be called as a witness in the defense case-in-chief. In light of the well settled rules
that a rebuttal expert is “intended solely to contradict or rebut evidence on the same subject
matter identified” in the expert report of another party, there would be no basis to for Dr. Esplin
to testify if Kliman and Coonan are excluded. Fed. R.Civ. P. 26(a)(2)(C)(ii). Moreover, because
Dr. Esplin is a designated rebuttal expert, it is entirely improper to have any portion of his
opinions or testimony presented in the Plaintiff’s case in chief. See Lindner v. Meadow Gold
Dairies, Inc.,249 F.R.D. 625, 636 (D. Hawaii 2008) (holding that individuals designated only as
rebuttal experts could present limited testimony, could not testify as part of a party's case-in-
chief, and would not be allowed to testify “unless and until” the experts they were designated to
rebut testified at trial); Johnson v. Grays Harbor Cmty. Hosp., No. C06–5502BHS, 2007 WL
4510313, at *2 (W.D.Wash. Dec. 18, 2007) (finding that experts designated as rebuttal witnesses
would “be permitted only to offer rebuttal testimony at trial”). Plaintiff also fails to explain how
the designated testimony could be deemed permissible given that the questions posed were all

outside of the scope of Dr. Esplin’s opinion. While Plaintiff may wish to waive this requirement
of the rules of procedure and evidence

outside of the scope of Dr. Esplin’s opinion. While Plaintiff may wish to waive this requirement
of the rules of procedure and evidence, Ms. Maxwell does not.
Regardless, any decisions Ms. Maxwell and the undersigned counsel decide to make
concerning their presentation of the defense and which witness to call is ours alone to make.
There is no requirement that a party call a designated expert to testify if they choose not to do so
at the time of trial. Such strategic decisions are solely in the province of the parties and their
counsel. If Dr. Esplin is presented as a rebuttal witness by the defense, he will appear live. If he
is not, then there is no rebuttal witness, and none to cross examine.
II. WAS NOT PROPERLY “REFRESHED” AND THE READING OF
THE HEARSAY POLICE REPORT IS INADMISSABLE
The use of the deposition testimony of , and the reading or summary of
hearsay statement in the Police Report sought to be admitted through counsel’s questions is
simply improper. As a small sampling of the designated testimony makes clear, there was no
proper “refreshing” of recollection:
Q. Do you remember how old you were when you met Jeffrey Epstein?
A. Sixteen or 17.
Q. Okay. And have you reviewed –
A. I may have been 15. I don't recall. I apologize.
Q. If you told the police officer 16, you were telling the truth?
A. At the time, they were fresh.
…
Q. Okay. After speaking to the police or while speaking to the police, do you remember
telling them that you're not safe because you're talking about this?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and foundation.
THE WITNESS: Yes.
BY MR. EDWARDS:
Q. And that you had heard Jeffrey Epstein making threats to people on the telephone?
MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and foundation.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1331-16 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 10
THE WITNESS: Yes. He wasn't always friendly
See Menninger Decl., Ex. F, 10:6-14; 43:15-44:4
As explained in in Wright & Miller, Federal Practice and Procedures, the use of a
document during testimony to refresh recollections is limited:
The law also places limits on how counsel and the witness may use a writing to refresh
memory. In the usual case counsel will hand the witness the writing, show counsel for the
adverse parties a copy, and ask the witness to silently read the writing. Counsel then will
ask the witness if the writing has refreshed the witness' memory. If the witness responds
in the affirmative, counsel will retrieve the writing and ask the witness to testify as to the
matters on which the witness' memory was refreshed. Even where the witness claims a
refreshed recollection, the court again has discretion to preclude further testimony if the
circumstances suggest that the writing engendered a false memory. If the witness states
that his recollection has not been refreshed, he cannot then testify as to the contents of the
writing unless it is shown that the writing itself is admissible.
§ 6184Refreshing Memory—Requirements and Procedures, 28 Fed. Prac. & Proc. Evid. § 6184
(2d ed.)(internal citations omitted); see also Goings v. U.S., 377 F.2d 753, 759–762 (8th Cir.
1967) (trial court improperly permitted prosecutor to ask leading questions concerning contents
of witness’ written statement under the pretext of refreshing recollection but without laying the
proper foundation; “[I]f a party can offer a previously given statement to substitute for a
witness’s testimony under the guise of ‘refreshing recollection,’ the whole adversary system of
trial must be revised. The evil of this practice hardly merits discussion. The evil is no less when
an attorney can read the statement in the presence of the jury and thereby substitute his spoken
word for the written document.”) (italics inoriginal). Gaines v. United States, 349 F.2d 190, 192
(D.C. Cir. 1965)(error to allow prior written statement to be read to the witness in front of the
jury for the purpose of refreshing recollection because “it was not necessary for counsel to read
the statements aloud in the jury's presence. This is liable to cause the jury to consider their
contents as evidence notwithstanding instructions to the contrary.”)

All testimony from deposition based on leading questions summarizing her
hearsay statements in the police report must be excluded.
With respect to the police report itself, this will obviously be a subject of a Motion in
Limine. At this time, two points will suffice. Plaintiff’s claim that she is not attempting to offer
the police report for the truth of the matters asserted therein is farcical, which is evident in every
briefing touching on the subject matter. Second, while the full 803(8) issue will be briefed, for
present purposes we will simply point out that (or any other witnesses statement
contained in the report) will never be admissible unless there is a separate and independent
hearsay exemptions for such statement. As the Second Circuit has clearly held:
“It is well established that entries in a police report which result from the officer's
own observations and knowledge may be admitted but that statements ma
