Dearest marianne,
While all of this infonnation would be great to have brought to light., it is in no favour or intention for me to put myself and story out there for nothing. I w
contact Orad Edwards lo see ifhe would still like to do a piece with Emily, and maybe even later down the track., when all is said and done there just might
be a helluva piece for the page 6.
God Bless you and yours .. .Take Care,
Jenna

Dear Jenna-
While I believe that your Jeffrey Epstein expose has tremendous merit, the only role that we can play is one where we are
not recompensed unless we are hired to do Public Relations and make a story happen at some later point.
Lord Colin Campbell and I do have huge respect for his countrywoman, the English-born Emily Smith. Colin is Scottish a1
his nephew is the Duke of Argyll, one of Scotland's primary, noble families.
Today Emily is one of the most noted, plus influential columnists in the United States, and yes, she is a friend of mine. We
can pop off an an-esting column item as a favor to her- if indeed the item is applicable for Page Six? But it must have true
gravitas.
No money changes hands in such a news release to a publication! If it helps, have your attorney write a suggested column
oriented item re your case and if it's written in 'journalistic style,' Colin and I can pop it off to Emily, as a possible piece f,
her renowned Page Six column. It's called 'pure favor time' to Emily from the owner of the item, plus the press person wh
may or may not elect to pop it into print.
I certainly do feel that down the long, winding road, your case has merit! God willing that it puts that piece of human scurr
back behind bars! Should you win the day, yes, T do believe that you can create a mighty manifesto on prostitution as it
exists in the U.S.A. in the years leading up to 2014-one that has real literary possibilities. If you win the case, contact us
and perhaps we can get it printed in a N.Y.C. newspaper? If you lose, a press release has nothing favorable for you,
obviously, and should be avoided.
Good luck and God Bless,
Maiianne Strong

Hi Marianne,
I hope you have been well since our last conversation. we lrnve been enjoying the amazing pre-spring heat. here in florida, I hope you do visit soon the
weather is absolutely splendid this year and it would be finally nice to meet you in person with so much we already know about each other and hopeful!:
more to come I!
/\bout the NYC Post, as you already know J have an extremely informative piece of the recent proceedings to tell both truth and justice as well as the past
history of the ill-esteemed billionaire mid registered sex offender. .k ffrey Epstein, that I unforhmately served four years as his personal and abused sex
slave 10, most of those years underage, and trust me J would like nothing more than the world to know all about the inequality of the government to act
appropriately and violate our rights as victims by giving Jeffrey Epstein a plea lxirgain and immunity to only take accreditation for one account of the
sensitive subject of procuring us undernge girls for the usage ofprostin1tion internationally to some of the world's most intluential people. But with that
comes a lot of responsibility for me to consider or "my neck on the line too" so to speak. Even though there is over forty women that were once
vulnernble girls that looked like the "sweet girl next door" but now that they have been taken advantage ofby this "disgusting wall street tyrant" most of
them have led a very unhealthy lifestyle since having served Jeffrey. such as drug addictions and prostitution and do not hold accreditation to
talk ... according to Jeffrey and his team of minion lawyers. lVliraculously since l came to light with the trnth and speaking out against him in 2011, the

If the NYC Post can agree to arrange a reasonable contract, above the competitors offer, then I will be able to give you all of the factual infonnation that
would give your mate Emily a great piece that l know is proceeding to be a rarily in the justice system, as well as being so rare of an atrocity, a new
article pertaining to Jeffrey, has just been written into state law, which l also have a copy of.
