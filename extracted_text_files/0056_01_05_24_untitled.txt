PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REOPEN DEFENDANT’S DEPOSITION BASED ON
DEFENDANT’S LATE PRODUCTION OF NEW, KEY DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Motion to
Reopen Defendant’s Deposition Based on Defendant’s Production of New, Key Documents because
Defendant produced documents subsequent to her deposition about which she should answer
questions. The Court has already ruled that reopening a party deposition is appropriate where
important documents are produced after the deposition is completed. Accordingly, the Court should
grant Ms. Giuffre’s request to reopen Defendant’s deposition to answer questions relating to her
lately produced documents.
I. BACKGROUND
The Court will recall Defendant’s case-long, unjustified recalcitrance regarding her
testimony. She first attempted to avoid her deposition (causing unnecessary motion practice),
and, then, she failed to answer questions at her deposition, upon which the Court ordered her to
sit for her deposition again. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre started her quest to obtain Defendant’s
deposition back on February 2, 2016,by serving a Notice of Deposition.Defendant filed a
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 10
Motion for Protective Order trying to avoid her deposition. After a hearing on the issue, the
Court directed Maxwell to sit for her deposition on April 22, 2016. During her deposition
Defendant refused to answer the majority of the questions asked or stated that she had no
memory of any of the events. As a result, Ms. Giuffre was forced to file a Motion to Compel
Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions Filed under Seal (DE 143). On June 20, 2016, this
Court granted Ms. Giuffre’s Motion and directed Defendant to sit for a second deposition to
answer the questions she originally failed to answer. (June 20, 2016 Sealed Order, filed in
redacted version DE 264-1).
Yet again at her second deposition, she continued to refuse to answer key questions. As a
result, on July 29, 2016, Ms. Giuffre was forced to file a Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order
and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions Filed under Seal. (DE 314/356).That
motion is still pending before this Court.
Discovery closed in this case on July 31, 2016. On August 16, 2016, after the close of
discovery, and after Defendant’s second deposition was taken, Defendant produced two critical
documents which were e-mail communications: one between her and her press agent, Ross Gow,
and another between her and her former boyfriend, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.See
McCawley Decl. at Sealed Composite Exhibit 1, August 16, 2016, email from Laura Menninger;
November 10, 2015, Email from Ross Gow to Defendant,GM_01141-01142; Email between
Defendant and Epstein, GM_01143-1144.
It is important for Ms. Giuffre to ask questions about these newly-produced
communications with Gow and Epstein. In the former, Gow asks Defendant, “Please advise how
you wish to respond [to a press inquiry regarding Ms. Giuffre].” As the Court will recall, Ross
Gow is Defendant’s English press agent who shares an attorney with Defendant. The history of
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 10
Ms. Giuffre’s multiple and expensive attempts to serve Mr. Gow with a Rule 45 subpoena
through the Hague Convention and various other means (Defendant’s attorney refused to accept
service) recently culminated in an English Court commanding Gow to sit for his deposition by
November 1, 2016.
Accordingly, a follow up deposition of Defendant is critical. It is necessary bothto ensure
that she answers the questions she refused to answer,(as set forth in Plaintiff’s Motion to Direct
Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions (DE 314/356)),and to ensure that Ms. Giuffre can
ask Defendant questions about the critical and late produced e-mail communications withher
press agent, Ross Gow, and withher former boyfriend, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Indeed, Defendant cannot credibly oppose Ms. Giuffre’s request because Defendant
herself previouslysought and received a deposition based on newly produced documents.
Defendant previously argued before this Court that Ms. Giuffre’s deposition should be reopened,
in part, because Ms. Giuffre obtained and produced certain documents that Defendant wanted to
askher about after Ms. Giuffre’s deposition was taken. Specifically, Defendant’s motion stated
“Plaintiff’s production of key documents after her deposition necessitates additional
examination.” See (DE 230) at 3. Defendant’s brief continued: “All of the new information that
has come to light . . . justifies the reopening of Plaintiff’s deposition.” Id. at 5-6.
The Court grantedDefendant’s motion in asealed Order that stated: “The deposition of
the Plaintiff was held on May 3, 2016, and thereafter the Plaintiff produced additional documents
and made supplemental responses . . . The Plaintiff may be questioned about any documents
produced subsequent to the M

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 10
when where important documents are produced after the deposition is completed, the same relief is
appropriate for Ms. Giuffre upon this motion.
II. ARGUMENT
The same standard set forth in theCourt’s August 30, 2016, Order applies to Defendant’s
post-deposition production of key documents. Defendant’s late production of two key documents
similarly“necessitates” and “justifies” the reopening of Defendant’s deposition for questioning
upon them. Therefore, Ms. Giuffre should receive the same relief from the Courtthat Defendant
obtained: the reopening of Defendant’s deposition to answer questions about these key
documents. See Wesley v. Muhammad, 2009 WL 1490607, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“while
defendants' delay in producing documents may have interfered with the completeness of
depositions, plaintiff will be free to reopen any depositions for which he deems the newly
produced documents to be a relevant source of questions”); Ganci v. U.S. Limousine Serv., Ltd.,
2011 WL 4407461 at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2011) (“Courts will typically reopen a deposition
where there is new information on which a witness should be questioned”).
Moreover,it was afterDefendant’s deposition was complete, and after the briefing to
reopen her deposition (on other grounds) was complete,and after discovery closed, that
Defendant produced these key documents. Ms. Giuffre should be allowed to ask Defendant
questions concerning them.
A. The Gow Email
These documentsare of particular importance because one is an email communication
from her agent, Ross Gow to Defendant that took place after the commencement of this
litigation. It states: “Hi Ghislaine and Philip [sic] Please advisehow you wish to respond… Best
Ross.”GM_01141. Ms. Giuffre did not have the opportunity to question Defendant about t■he
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 10
content of that email, a communication with a key witness, nor did she have the opportunity to
use it to cross some of Defendant’s evasive answers. Additionally, due to the late production,
Ms. Giuffre did not have the opportunity to include these facts in her briefing related to her
Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions
Filed under Seal (DE 315).
a. Gow Deposition Testimony
Defendant refused to give a straight answer regarding Mr. Gow at her first deposition,
making a line of questions related to the lately-produced email communication important and
non-redundant. For example, when asked about Mr. Gow, Defendant gave evasive,andnon-
responsiveanswers:
Q. Did you issue a statement to your press agent, Ross Gow in 2015, stating that Virginia
Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
Q. You can answer.
A. You need to reask me the question.
Q. Sure.
Did you issue a press statement through your press agent, Ross Gow, in January of 2015,
stating that Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
A. Can you ask it a different way, please?
Q. I will ask it again and you can listen carefully. Did you issue a press statement
through your press agent, Ross Gow, in January of 2015, where you stated that Virginia
Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
A. So my lawyer, Philip Barden instructed Ross Gow to issue a statement.
See McCawley Decl. at Sealed Composite Exhibit 2, Maxwell Depo. Tr. at 201:17-202:11.
Q. Are you saying that it's an obvious lie that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual conduct
with Virginia while Virginia was underage?
A. Again, I'm telling you, first of all, it was a statement that was issued by my lawyer
and --through my lawyer to Ross Gow.
Q. I understand that. I'm asking you, are you saying that it's an obvious lie that Jeffrey
Epstein engaged in sexual conduct with Virginia while Virginia was underage. Is that a
lie?
Q. You can answer.
A. So I cannot testifyto what Ross Gow and Philip Barden decided to put -- I can testify
to what Virginia's obvious lies are as regards to me. I cannot make representations about
all the many lies she may or may not have told about Jeffrey.

Giuffre should not be prejudiced or penalized by Defendant’s late production, just as Defendant
was not prejudiced nor penalized by Ms. Giuffre late production.
