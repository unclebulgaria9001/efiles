PLAINTIFF’S UNREDACTED REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO COMPEL
DEFENDANT TO ANSWER DEPOSITION QUESTIONS
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files th-is
Reply in Support of her Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions. Instead
of allowing Ms. Giuffre to take a full and complete deposition,Defendant flatly refused to
answer questions critical to the key issues in this case. Contrary to Defendant’s assertions, Ms.
Giuffre is not engaged in a “fishing expedition” but rather seeks to ask highly-focused questions
specifically relevant to this case. In particular, Ms. Giuffre seeks to ask the Defendant questions
regarding her participation in or knowledge of sexual activities connected with Jeffrey Epstein’s
sexual abuse of females. Such questions are entirely appropriate in the discovery phase of this
case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as confidential under the Protective
Order entered in this case.
As the Court is aware from previous pleadings, at the heart of this case lies the issue of
Defendant’s knowledge that Ms. Giuffre was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Indeed, as the
Defendant boldly acknowledges in her response (at p. 2), she intends to argue at trialthat (among
other things) she “never arranged for or asked [Ms. Giuffre] to have sex with anyone.” At trial,

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 2 of 10
Ms. Giuffre intends to strongly disproveDefendant’s false assertions and to demonstratethat
Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre to be involved in massages of a sexual nature with Epstein.
To develop evidence to support her position, Ms. Giuffre recently deposed Defendant
about the central subjects in her case. Defendant flatly refused to answer a number of questions,
and for the majority of the others, gave varying versions of “I don’t recall.” For example, when
faced with the police report which contains statements from approximatelythirty (30) different
victims during a time frame which the Defendant acknowledges she was actively working for
Epstein at his various homes, Defendant challenged the veracity of the victims’reports:
“Q. Are you saying these 30 girls are lying when they gave these reports to police
officers?
A. I’m not testifying to their lies. I’m testifying to Virginia’s lies.”
SeeDeclaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016
Deposition of Defendant at p. 89-90; 83-84. WhileDefendant was working with Epstein during
the time period when these underage girls were visiting Jeffrey’s home, Defendant claimedto be
at the house maybe once in 2005. Id.at p. 84. Yet, according to flight manifests, in that same
general time period, Defendant was listed as a passengerat least eleven times either landing in or
departing from West Palm Beach, Florida on Jeffrey Epstein’sprivateplane. SeeMcCawley
Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Depo Tr. at p. 84; seealso McCawley Decl.at Composite
Exhibit 2, Flight Logs from Jeffrey Epstein’s private planes.
Moreover, again according to flight logs, Defendant was on Epstein’s planes over 300
times –including 23 times with Ms. Giuffre when Ms. Giuffre was underage. Yet, quite
remarkably, Defendant claimed she “couldn’t recall”even oneof those flights. SeeMcCawley
Decl.at Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 120-122.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 3 of 10
Defendant even testified that she did not recall having Ms. Giuffre at her London
townhome with Prince Andrew. Defendant stuck to this incredible storydespite flight logs
establishing her traveling to London with Ms. Giuffre and despite a photographthe three –Ms.
Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Defendant – all standing together in Defendant’s home. See
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 108-111.
Defendant’s deposition consisted almost entirely of “I don’t recalls” or “I refuse to answer that
question”1 and also included a physical outburst that knocked the court reporter’s computer off
the conference room table. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Deposition of
Defendant at 207-208.
Among the many questions that Defendant refused to answer at her deposition werea
number of questions designed to show that Defendant was well aware that, for Epstein, a
“massage” was actually a code word sexual activity –i.e., not a therapeutic massage but rather
activity that involved sexual gratification for Epstein. Defendant refused to answer all such
questions, asserting that they involved “private adult sexual relationships” which did not “relate
in any way” to Ms. Giuffre’s claims. Id. at p. 4. But Defendant’s involvement in such
“relationships” with Epstein would show that she knew full well the fate that was in store for Ms.
Giuffre when she accepted Defendant’s invitation to come and provide “massages” to Epstein.
Defendant admitted that she worked for Epstein from 1992to 2009. SeeMcCawley Decl. at

1For example, when asked:
“Q. Have you ever said to anybody that you recruit girls to take the pressure off you, so you
won’t have to have sex with Jeffrey, have you said that?
A. You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap me, I will not be
trapped. You are asking me if I recruit. I told you no. Girls meaning underage, I already said I don’t do
that with underage people and as to ask me about a specific conversation I had with language, we talking
about almost 17 years ago when this took place. I cannot testify to an actual conversation or language
that I used with anybody at any time.”
SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Depo Tr. at p. 94-95.

Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 10-11, 410. As the Court knows, the
Palm Beach Police Report demonstrates multiple incidents of “massages” being given by
untrained minor children that involved sexual acts. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3,Palm
Beach Police Report. Defendant is also identified in that Palm Beach Police Report. See
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Palm Beach Police Report at p. 75-76. And the details of
Epstein’s sexual activities with Defendant (for example) are highly relevant to this case, because
they will help corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s testimony that, while she was underage, she also
engaged in sexual activity of an identical nature with Epstein.
Toallow Defendant to avoid answering these questions would preclude Ms. Giuffre from
getting critical evidence in this case. Consider, for example, Defendant recruitingan eighteen
year-old girl to be an “assistant,” bringingthat girl to Epstein’s home,tellingher she could make
more money if she would give Epstein a massage, and then instructingher to give a massage that
involved sexual acts. Under Defendant’s theory of discovery, Ms. Giuffre would be precluded
from deposing her on that topic because the actions would culminate in “consensual adult sex.”
Yet, that scenario would fully validatethe pattern of events that occurred with Ms. Giuffre when
she was under the age of eighteen. It would obviously show a “modus operandi”by Jeffrey
Epstein and Defendant, which is clearly admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).
Moreover, such inquiries are crucial to impeaching the Defendant at trial. During her
deposition, Defendant attempted to characterize her work for Epstein as nothing more than a
normal job handling hiring for the various mansions. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April
22, 2016 Deposition Tr. of Defendant at p. 9-12. Ms. Giuffre should be able to contest that
assertion by having Defendant fully answer questions about whether that alleged“job” involved

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 5 of 10
sexual activities, including orchestrating the hiring of females and converting massages into
sexual encounters.
Defendant attempts to paint the picture that Ms. Giuffre somehow is interested in all
sexual relationships that the Defendant may have been involved with. That is not true. Ms.
Giuffre has no intention of asking unbridled questions. To be clear, Ms. Giuffre intends to ask
Defendant only questions that involve the followingvery narrow and crucial subject areas: (1)
Defendant’s sexual relationship with Epstein from 1992 to 2009 –the time period in which she
worked for Jeffrey Epstein and which Epstein (with the assistance of Defendant) was engaging in
sexual acts withfemales under the cover of “massage”; (2) Defendant’s sexual interactionswith
any person in Epstein’s presenceduring that time period; (3) Defendant’s sexual activities at
Epstein’s residences, including his private island “Little St. Jeff’s,” or his aircraftduring that
time period; (4) Defendant’s sexual activities with identified participants in Epstein’s sexual
abuseduring that time period; and (5) Defendant’s sexual interactions that occurred during or
through what began as a “massage”; and (6) Defendant’s interactions with females to introduce
to Jeffrey Epstein for the purpose of performing work, including sexual massages.
Defendant claimsthat such questions are a mere “fishing expedition” without
acknowledging the fact that these questions go to critical issues in this case. Other witnesses
have testified regarding Defendant’s involvement in recruiting females for sex under the cover of
a “massage.” During the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, certain household staff was deposed.
Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Jeffrey Epstein’s household manager, testified that the Defendant
frequently stayed in Jeffrey Epstein’s home and assisted with bringing in young girls to act as
“masseuses” for Jeffrey Epstein.
