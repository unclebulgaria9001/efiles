TA Reported By: KRAUEL, CURTIS D. 12/21/05
Entered By.: ALTOMARO, NICKIE A. 12/21/05
On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way,
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det . Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det. Recarey to a room desi gnated as
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a , Silver in color, CPU ith the
left side cover removed, exposing t qe CPU s hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in . Th keyboard and mouse were atop the
CPU It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a onitor,
