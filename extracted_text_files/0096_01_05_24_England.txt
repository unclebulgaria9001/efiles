PLAINTIFF'S SEALED AGREED MOTION TO FILE MOTION TO COMPEL THE
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN
UNDER SEAL PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 5.4(b) AND MOTION TO PLACE THE
ENTIRE DOCKET UNDER SEAL
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits
this Unopposed Motion to file her Motion to Compel the Production of Documents and
Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein under Seal Pursuant to Local Rule 5.4(b) and Motion to Place
the Entire Docket Under Seal, and hereby states as follows.
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The motion to compel seeks to compel production pursuant to a valid Rule 45 subpoena
issued to Jeffrey Epstein in the above-styled case, pending in the Southern District of New York
(the "New York case"). The case concerns a defamation action brought by a child victim of
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein against his live-in girlfriend who assisted him in procuring
underage girls, including the plaintiff, Ms. Giuffre. Because of Epstein's central role in the New
York case, it is important for Ms. Giuffre to have the requested documents from him in
discovery.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 43
During his deposition, Epstein failed to answer questions or produce documents in
response to a Rule 45 subpoena in the New York case. The instant motion seeks to compel
production from Epstein in three areas, detailed more fully in the Motion to Compel, based on
his improper invocation of the Fifth Amendment in refusing to comply with the subpoena.
Epstein's invocation of the Fifth Amendment was invalid for several reasons, as discussed in
detail in the Motion to Compel. One of those reasons, however, goes to the instant request to file
the motion to compel under seal and to place the docket under seal. In should be noted that the
entire deposition of Epstein is confidential, having been placed under the confidentiality order
that exists in the case.
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
The parties agree this case should be placed under seal because of the need for
confidentiality. There is no valid invocation of the Fifth Amendment when there is no threat to
self-incrimination, and there can be no threat to self-incrimination if the government is not aware
of the information Ms. Giuffre seeks pursuant to her valid Rule 45 subpoena. Because Ms.
Giuffre seeks to have all of the relevant proceedings to her motion to compel -including the
motion itself -be placed under seal at this time, the Government will not be aware of Epstein's
disclosure of materials, much less be in position to even file a motion to attempt alter the
protective order. In such circumstances, Epstein faces no "real and substantial hazard" of his act
of producing documents to Ms. Giuffre' s counsel incriminating himself. See United States v.
Kowalik, 809 F. Supp. 1571, 1577 (S.D. Fla. 1992), afj'd, 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993), and ajj'd,
12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, by placing this case under seal, this Co

PLAINTIFF'S SEALED AGREED MOTION TO FILE MOTION TO COMPEL THE

Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 43
During his deposition, Epstein failed to answer questions or produce documents in
response to a Rule 45 subpoena in the New York case. The instant motion seeks to compel
production from Epstein in three areas, detailed more fully in the Motion to Compel, based on
his improper invocation of the Fifth Amendment in refusing to comply with the subpoena.
Epstein's invocation of the Fifth Amendment was invalid for several reasons, as discussed in

the motion to compel under seal and to place the docket under seal. In should be noted that the
entire deposition of Epstein is confidential, having been placed under the confidentiality order
that exists in the case.
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
The parties agree this case should be placed under seal because of the need for
confidentiality. There is no valid invocation of the Fifth Amendment when there is no threat to
self-incrimination, and there can be no threat to self-incrimination if the government is not aware
of the information Ms. Giuffre seeks pursuant to her valid Rule 45 subpoena. Because Ms.
Giuffre seeks to have all of the relevant proceedings to her motion to compel -including the
motion itself -be placed under seal at this time, the Government will not be aware of Epstein's
disclosure of materials, much less be in position to even file a motion to attempt alter the
protective order. In such circumstances, Epstein faces no "real and substantial hazard" of his act
of producing documents to Ms. Giuffre' s counsel incriminating himself. See United States v.
Kowalik, 809 F. Supp. 1571, 1577 (S.D. Fla. 1992), afj'd, 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993), and ajj'd,
12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, by placing this case under seal, this Court can grant
Ms. Giuffre's motion to compel and direct Epstein to produce the relevant documents over his
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 43
improper Fifth Amendment objections because there is no risk of incrimination because these
proceedings will be under seal.
Moreover, under the Protective Order issued by the New York case, Ms. Giuffre's
counsel (and counsel for Ms. Maxwell,1 the Defendant in the New York case) are forbidden to
disclose the materials for "any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case." Protective
Order,~ 4. Under the terms of the protective order, all materials secured in the case will be
destroyed at the end of tl1e case. Protective Order,~ 12. And while the Protective Order does
not bar the use of confidential materials at trial, Protective Order~ 13, Ms. Giuffre's counsel
represent that they will not use at trial any documents that Epstein produces without first
notifying Epstein and seeking leave of Court to do so. As a result, Epstein can provide
documents to Ms. Giuffre, allowing her to investigate this case without compromising any
interest that Epstein may have in avoiding self-incrimination.
Additionally, the entire deposition has already been designated as "confidential" by
defendant Maxwell, making these proceedings subject to a protective order. See Motion to
Compel at Addendum A (copy of protective order). To enforce that previously-entered
confidentiality order from the Southern District of New York, these proceedings should be
confidential as well. Moreover, in such circumstances, there is no substantial risk of
incrimination from the mere production of documents to Ms. Giuffre's counsel, who are subject
to the protective order. See generally Marc Youngelson, The Use of2 6(c) Protective Orders:
"Pleading the Fifth" Without Suffering "Adverse" Consequences, 1994 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 245
(1995); see also Palmieri v. State ofNew York, 779 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1985).
1 It may be relevant to note that defendant Maxwell has not sought any documents from Epstein,
and thus the only issue presented here is the extent to which Ms. Giuffre can use the documents.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 43
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 authorizes a court, for good cause, to enter a
protective order to seal or to limit disclosure. Indeed, courts have the discretion to place entire
cases under seal. See e.g. Beaches MLS, Inc. v. Miami Association ofR ealtors, Inc., 2015 WL
11170925, at *3 (S.D.Fla. 2015) (Marra, J.) (granting motion to file under seal and sealing the
case). Local Rule 5 .4(b) provides the procedure to follow when a party seeks to file something
under seal: the party must file a motion, "setting forth a reasonable basis for departing from the
general policy of a public filing," and courts in this district routinely grant parties' motions to file
under seal for good cause. See e.g. Shire Development LLC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 932
F.Supp.2d 1349, 1359 (S.D.Fla. 2013) (Middlebrooks, J.); Air Turbine Technology, Inc. v. Atlas
Copco AB, 2003 WL 22939256, at* 1 (S.D.Fla. 2003) (Marra, J.).
Ms. Giuffre has articulated good cause to grant her motion to file under seal and to seal
this case, as it would facilitate the execution of a valid Rule 45 subpoena issued upon Jeffrey
Epstein and follow the confidentiality order previously entered in this case by the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Counsel for Ms. Giuffre has conferred with counsel
for Epstein, and counsel for Epstein has agreed to the filing of the Motion to Compel under seal.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, respectfully requests that the
Court grant her Agreed Motion to file her Motion to Compel the Production of Documents and
Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein under Seal Pursuant to Local Rule 5.4(b) and Motion to Place
the Entire Docket Under Seal for the reasons set forth above.
