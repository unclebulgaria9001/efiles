## What About the Gibberish?

Entries like "Oa Zpv", "Mo Lnf", "Dy Zftx", etc. are:
- **PDF extraction artifacts** - corrupted text from scanned documents
- **Encoding errors** - binary data interpreted as text
- **Metadata codes** - document processing markers
- **NOT real people**

---

## Recommendations

1. **For analysis, focus on these 10-12 confirmed real people**
2. **Virginia Giuffre** is mentioned 120 times in metadata but text extraction failed
3. **Consider OCR** for scanned documents to extract more names
4. **Cross-reference** with external sources for complete picture
5. **Many key figures** (Trump, Clinton, Prince Andrew, etc.) are not in this specific document set

---

## How to Find More People

The current extraction is limited by:
1. **PDF quality** - many are scanned images
2. **Text extraction method** - basic ASCII extraction
3. **Document set** - only 388 of thousands of documents

**To improve**:
- Use OCR (Optical Character Recognition)
- Obtain additional document sets
- Manual review of PDFs
- Cross-reference with flight logs, black book, etc.
