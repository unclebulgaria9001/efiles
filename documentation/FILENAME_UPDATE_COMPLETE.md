## 📝 Technical Details

### Name Extraction Logic
1. Extracts From/To from email headers
2. Removes email addresses (keeps names only)
3. Takes first name if multiple recipients
4. Sanitizes for Windows filename compatibility
5. Limits length to prevent path issues

### Filename Sanitization
- Removes: `< > : " / \ | ? *`
- Replaces with: `_`
- Removes extra spaces
- Limits component lengths:
  - From name: 25 characters max
  - To name: 25 characters max
  - Date: 20 characters max
  - Subject: 40 characters max

### Character Limits
- Total filename: ~200 characters max
- Prevents Windows path length issues
- Maintains readability
- Preserves key information
