## 🎯 The Central Mystery

### Where Did Epstein's Money Come From?

**The Official Story:**
- Made fortune managing money for billionaires
- Only worked with clients worth $1 billion+

**The Problem:**
- **Only ONE confirmed major client**: Leslie Wexner
- No documented investment track record
- Opaque financial structure
- Lifestyle exceeds explained income

**The Wexner Connection (KEY):**
- Wexner gave Epstein complete financial control (power of attorney)
- Transferred $77M Manhattan mansion to Epstein
- 20-year relationship
- Wexner claims Epstein "misappropriated" funds
- **Full story never explained**

### Critical Questions

1. **Source of Wealth**: Where did the billions come from?
2. **Client List**: Who else besides Wexner?
3. **Wexner's Role**: What really happened?
4. **Network Extent**: Who else was involved?
5. **Victim Count**: How many total?
6. **Intelligence Ties**: Any government connections? (unverified)
