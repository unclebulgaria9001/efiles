## 🔑 Key Findings

### The Central Mystery: Where Did the Money Come From?

**Official Story**: Epstein made his fortune managing money for billionaires

**Problems**:
- Only ONE confirmed major client: Leslie Wexner
- No documented investment track record
- Opaque financial structure
- Lifestyle exceeds explained income

**The Wexner Connection** (CRITICAL):
- Wexner gave Epstein complete financial control (power of attorney)
- Transferred $77M Manhattan mansion to Epstein
- 20-year relationship
- Wexner claims Epstein "misappropriated" funds
- **Full story never explained**

### What the Documents Show

**From 388 Court Documents**:
- Virginia Giuffre: 120 mentions (primary victim/witness)
- Ghislaine Maxwell: 52 mentions (convicted recruiter)
- Jeffrey Epstein: 6 mentions (surprisingly low)
- Multiple properties referenced
- Network of associates identified
- Pattern of illegal activity documented

### What's Still Unknown

1. **Source of wealth** - Where did the billions come from?
2. **Client list** - Who else besides Wexner?
3. **Wexner's role** - What really happened?
4. **Full network** - Who else was involved?
