Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 1 of 10
United States District Court
Southern District of New York
Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
v.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S MOTION TO REOPEN DEFENDANT’S DEPOSITION BASED ON
DEFENDANT’S LATE PRODUCTION OF NEW, KEY DOCUMENTS
Plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, files this Motion to
Reopen Defendant’s Deposition Based on Defendant’s Production of New, Key Documents because
Defendant produced documents subsequent to her deposition about which she should answer
questions. The Court has already ruled that reopening a party deposition is appropriate where
important documents are produced after the deposition is completed. Accordingly, the Court should
grant Ms. Giuffre’s request to reopen Defendant’s deposition to answer questions relating to her
lately produced documents.
I. BACKGROUND
The Court will recall Defendant’s case-long, unjustified recalcitrance regarding her
testimony. She first attempted to avoid her deposition (causing unnecessary motion practice),
and, then, she failed to answer questions at her deposition, upon which the Court ordered her to
sit for her deposition again. Specifically, Ms. Giuffre started her quest to obtain Defendant’s
deposition back on February 2, 2016,by serving a Notice of Deposition.Defendant filed a
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 2 of 10
Motion for Protective Order trying to avoid her deposition. After a hearing on the issue, the
Court directed Maxwell to sit for her deposition on April 22, 2016. During her deposition
Defendant refused to answer the majority of the questions asked or stated that she had no
memory of any of the events. As a result, Ms. Giuffre was forced to file a Motion to Compel
Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions Filed under Seal (DE 143). On June 20, 2016, this
Court granted Ms. Giuffre’s Motion and directed Defendant to sit for a second deposition to
answer the questions she originally failed to answer. (June 20, 2016 Sealed Order, filed in
redacted version DE 264-1).
Yet again at her second deposition, she continued to refuse to answer key questions. As a
result, on July 29, 2016, Ms. Giuffre was forced to file a Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order
and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions Filed under Seal. (DE 314/356).That
motion is still pending before this Court.
Discovery closed in this case on July 31, 2016. On August 16, 2016, after the close of
discovery, and after Defendant’s second deposition was taken, Defendant produced two critical
documents which were e-mail communications: one between her and her press agent, Ross Gow,
and another between her and her former boyfriend, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.See
McCawley Decl. at Sealed Composite Exhibit 1, August 16, 2016, email from Laura Menninger;
November 10, 2015, Email from Ross Gow to Defendant,GM_01141-01142; Email between
Defendant and Epstein, GM_01143-1144.
It is important for Ms. Giuffre to ask questions about these newly-produced
communications with Gow and Epstein. In the former, Gow asks Defendant, “Please advise how
you wish to respond [to a press inquiry regarding Ms. Giuffre].” As the Court will recall, Ross
Gow is Defendant’s English press agent who shares an attorney with Defendant. The history of
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 3 of 10
Ms. Giuffre’s multiple and expensive attempts to serve Mr. Gow with a Rule 45 subpoena
through the Hague Convention and various other means (Defendant’s attorney refused to accept
service) recently culminated in an English Court commanding Gow to sit for his deposition by
November 1, 2016.
Accordingly, a follow up deposition of Defendant is critical. It is necessary bothto ensure
that she answers the questions she refused to answer,(as set forth in Plaintiff’s Motion to Direct
Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions (DE 314/356)),and to ensure that Ms. Giuffre can
ask Defendant questions about the critical and late produced e-mail communications withher
press agent, Ross Gow, and withher former boyfriend, convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein.
Indeed, Defendant cannot credibly oppose Ms. Giuffre’s request because Defendant
herself previouslysought and received a deposition based on newly produced documents.
Defendant previously argued before this Court that Ms. Giuffre’s deposition should be reopened,
in part, because Ms. Giuffre obtained and produced certain documents that Defendant wanted to
askher about after Ms. Giuffre’s deposition was taken. Specifically, Defendant’s motion stated
“Plaintiff’s production of key documents after her deposition necessitates additional
examination.” See (DE 230) at 3. Defendant’s brief continued: “All of the new information that
has come to light . . . justifies the reopening of Plaintiff’s deposition.” Id. at 5-6.
The Court grantedDefendant’s motion in asealed Order that stated: “The deposition of
the Plaintiff was held on May 3, 2016, and thereafter the Plaintiff produced additional documents
and made supplemental responses . . . The Plaintiff may be questioned about any documents
produced subsequent to the May 3 deposition relating to employment and education.”SeeSealed
August 30, 2016 Order. As the Court has already ruled that reopening a deposition is appropriate
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 10
when where important documents are produced after the deposition is completed, the same relief is
appropriate for Ms. Giuffre upon this motion.
II. ARGUMENT
The same standard set forth in theCourt’s August 30, 2016, Order applies to Defendant’s
post-deposition production of key documents. Defendant’s late production of two key documents
similarly“necessitates” and “justifies” the reopening of Defendant’s deposition for questioning
upon them. Therefore, Ms. Giuffre should receive the same relief from the Courtthat Defendant
obtained: the reopening of Defendant’s deposition to answer questions about these key
documents. See Wesley v. Muhammad, 2009 WL 1490607, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. 2009) (“while
defendants' delay in producing documents may have interfered with the completeness of
depositions, plaintiff will be free to reopen any depositions for which he deems the newly
produced documents to be a relevant source of questions”); Ganci v. U.S. Limousine Serv., Ltd.,
2011 WL 4407461 at *2 (E.D.N.Y. Sept. 21, 2011) (“Courts will typically reopen a deposition
where there is new information on which a witness should be questioned”).
Moreover,it was afterDefendant’s deposition was complete, and after the briefing to
reopen her deposition (on other grounds) was complete,and after discovery closed, that
Defendant produced these key documents. Ms. Giuffre should be allowed to ask Defendant
questions concerning them.
A. The Gow Email
These documentsare of particular importance because one is an email communication
from her agent, Ross Gow to Defendant that took place after the commencement of this
litigation. It states: “Hi Ghislaine and Philip [sic] Please advisehow you wish to respond… Best
Ross.”GM_01141. Ms. Giuffre did not have the opportunity to question Defendant about t■he
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 10
content of that email, a communication with a key witness, nor did she have the opportunity to
use it to cross some of Defendant’s evasive answers. Additionally, due to the late production,
Ms. Giuffre did not have the opportunity to include these facts in her briefing related to her
Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions
Filed under Seal (DE 315).
a. Gow Deposition Testimony
Defendant refused to give a straight answer regarding Mr. Gow at her first deposition,
making a line of questions related to the lately-produced email communication important and
non-redundant. For example, when asked about Mr. Gow, Defendant gave evasive,andnon-
responsiveanswers:
Q. Did you issue a statement to your press agent, Ross Gow in 2015, stating that Virginia
Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
Q. You can answer.
A. You need to reask me the question.
Q. Sure.
Did you issue a press statement through your press agent, Ross Gow, in January of 2015,
stating that Virginia Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
A. Can you ask it a different way, please?
Q. I will ask it again and you can listen carefully. Did you issue a press statement
through your press agent, Ross Gow, in January of 2015, where you stated that Virginia
Roberts' claims were, quote, obvious lies?
A. So my lawyer, Philip Barden instructed Ross Gow to issue a statement.
See McCawley Decl. at Sealed Composite Exhibit 2, Maxwell Depo. Tr. at 201:17-202:11.
Q. Are you saying that it's an obvious lie that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in sexual conduct
with Virginia while Virginia was underage?
A. Again, I'm telling you, first of all, it was a statement that was issued by my lawyer
and --through my lawyer to Ross Gow.
Q. I understand that. I'm asking you, are you saying that it's an obvious lie that Jeffrey
Epstein engaged in sexual conduct with Virginia while Virginia was underage. Is that a
lie?
Q. You can answer.
A. So I cannot testifyto what Ross Gow and Philip Barden decided to put -- I can testify
to what Virginia's obvious lies are as regards to me. I cannot make representations about
all the many lies she may or may not have told about Jeffrey.

See McCawley Decl. at Sealed Composite Exhibit 2, Maxwell Depo. Tr. at 202:24-204:6.Ms.
Giuffre should not be prejudiced or penalized by Defendant’s late production, just as Defendant
was not prejudiced nor penalized by Ms. Giuffre late production.
b. Gow Requests for Admission Responses
Importantly, Defendant’s evasive responses regarding Ross Gow in her An-swers to Ms.
Giuffre’s Requests for Admission1 necessitate reopening of questioning regarding thenewly-
produced,post-lawsuit communication with Mr. Gow.For example, Defendant stated as
follows:
1. Admit that Ross Gow was authorized by You or your agents to make statements to
the public on your behalf.
Ms. Maxwell objects to this Request based on the vagueness of the terms “authorized”,
“statements to the public,” and “agents”. Without waiver of the foregoing, Ms. Maxwell
responds as follows:
Denied in part. Ms. Maxwell admits that she has worked with Mr. Gow on occasion for
several years and that she has corresponded with Mr. Gow regarding communications to
members of the British press to reserve her right to seek redress for their repetition of
defamatory statements about Ms. Maxwell.
SeeMcCawley Decl. at Sealed Exhibit 3, Defendant’s Responses to Plaintiff’s Requests for
Admission at 3. Defendant’s evasive response claims the word “authorize” is too “vague,” but, at
the same time, she appears to deny “inpart”that she authorized Gow to make the defamatory
statement. However,the newly-produced communication with Gow shows an ongoing and
continuing working relationship, where Gow is seeking Defendant’s approval and input on
issuing a statement to the press. Ms. Giuffre should be entitled to ask Defendant questions about
that communication,whereinGow asks her: “Please advise how you wish to respond.”Notably,
1Plaintiff attempted to meet and confer with Defendant in order to obtain a follow up deposition regarding these
newly produced documents without Court intervention. Defendant refused stating that she would consider
responding to written questions. However, as the Court can see from Defendant’s pattern of evasive written
responses, an oral deposition is necessary in order to attempt to obtain a complete response.
6
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 7 of 10
Defendant did not produce her response to Gow’s email.Additionally, since the communication
appears to directly contradict her deposition testimony as well as her responses to Requests for
Admission, Ms. Giuffre should be entitled to use this post-litigation communication, where Gow
asks Defendant,“Please advise how you wish to respond,”to cross Defendant on her prior
deposition answers.An email in which Gow is actively soliciting instructions for how to make a
public response to the media is evidence that Defendant is, in fact, involved in, and consulted
about,what her press agent says on her behalf.
B. Communication with Jeffrey Epstein
Similarly, the email with Epstein regarding a reply to “one further allegation,” shows that
Defendant is active in shaping her public statements regarding Ms. Giuffre, and giving drafts to
Epstein for his approval. Accordingly, Defendant was never deposed on (1) why she was seeking
Epstein’s permission for having Barden make a “reply;” (2) what Epstein’s relationship was with
Barden; (3) or who drafted the original communication at the bottom of the email, as it does not
appear to have been created by either Defendant or Epstein.
C. Ms. Giuffre Did Not Oppose the Relief Sought When Defendant Brought
The Same Motion and the Court Ruled that this Relief was Appropriate
As the Court will recall, Ms. Giuffre did not opposethe relief sought in Defendant’s
motion to reopen herdeposition. (“Ms. Giuffre agrees to reopen the deposition for a limited
amount of time, and for discrete lines of questioning.” DE 259 at 1). And, Ms. Giuffre
specifically agreed to the relief of answering questions about, inter alia, documents produced
after her deposition: “Ms. Giuffre agrees to reopening the deposition for certain questions related
to the following: 1) Any medical care records that were produced subsequent to her deposition.”
(DE259 at 12).Accordingly, as Defendant sought and receivedthe same relief upon her motion,
which was unopposed by Ms. Giuffre, Defendant can put forth no valid argument against re-
7
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-8 Filed 01/05/24 Page 8 of 10
opening Defendant’s deposition to ask questions about these newly-produced documents,
particularly given the case law that also requires the re-opening of a deposition in these
circumstances.
III. CONCLUSION
Therefore, based on the foregoing, Ms. Giuffre respectfully requests that the Court
Reopen Defendant’s deposition to (1) answer lines of questions discussed in Ms. Giuffre’s
Motion to Enforce the Court’s Order and Direct Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions
Filed under Seal (DE 315)which is pending before the Court; and (2) answer questions related to
the two key documents produced by Defendant after her deposition.
