10 Q. Did you ever tell Johanna that she
11 would get extra money if she provided Jeffrey
12 massages?
13 A. I was always happy to give career
14 advice to people and I think that becoming
15 somebody in the healthcare profession, either
16 exercise instructor or nutritionist or
17 professional massage therapist is an
18 excellent job opportunity. Hourly wages are
19 around 7, 8, $9 and as a professional
20 healthcare provider you can earn somewhere
