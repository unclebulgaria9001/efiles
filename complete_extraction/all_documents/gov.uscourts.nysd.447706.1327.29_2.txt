1 in your view?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Did you ever -- did you at that time
4 wonder why she was traveling with Jeffrey?
5 A. At that time, I did not.
6 Q. Did you later wonder that?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And what was your impression?
9 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, vague,
10 speculative.
11 THE WITNESS: I -- we're jumping ahead; is
12 that okay?
13 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
14 Q. Yes, that's okay.
15 A. A few days later, I remember asking her
16 questions to try to figure out her role, why she was
17 there, and she gave me vague answers and was never
18 specific.
19 And so I thought perhaps she just was an
20 assistant, someone that did massages well. I wanted
21 to believe that she was innocent.
22 Q. Did you ever refer to her as being
23 orphan-like?
24 A. I did.
25 Q. And how did that come about?

23 Q. And do you recall who you -- who went with
24 you to the Virgin Islands?

1 observed her personality to be?
2 A. Sure. She definitely had a great sense of
3 humor, she loved making jokes. I mean, in a very
4 British way. I don't remember her ever laughing,
5 but she was funny.
6 And I remember just thinking, she -- the
7 first weekend that we flew to the Virgin Islands,
8 she flew the helicopter from Saint, wherever we were
9 to little Saint Jeff [sic] or whatever the name of
10 the island was, and I just thought, wow, who is this
11 woman.
12 Q. Would you say that you respected her?

23 on the Intracoastal. The house was either white or
24 pink. It was pink at one time it may have been
25 painted. It was nothing fancy, it was large, it was

2 Q. Did you go anywhere with Virginia?
3 A. Oh, my gosh, yes. We went to Phantom of
4 the Opera.
5 Q. Who else went?
6 A. I think it was just she and I. I forgot
7 about that. Thank you for that memory.

10 in New York?

13 Jeffrey while you were there on that trip or was it
14 a subsequent trip?
15 A. That trip.
16 Q. And how did that come to be?
17 A. Either he or somebody asked me to go and
18 do it. Someone showed me to the room, but I don't
19 remember who it was.
20 Q. Can you describe that room?
21 A. Yes. It was high ceilings, dark. There
22 were, like, dark red walls or dark blue walls or
23 dark blue carpeting or something. It had a massage
24 table set up in the middle, and there was a large --
25 I want to say like a 15-foot photo, either photo or

1 Q. Do you know personally whether anyone else
2 had said no to him?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Did anyone ever tell you that they had
5 been in a massage scenario and told him no?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Do you recall when in your trip the
8 massage occurred?
9 A. Well, it was not the day we landed. It
10 must have been that next day that we were there.
11 Q. Do you remember anything else about
12 Virginia from that trip other than the Prince Andrew
13 thing and Phantom of the Opera?
14 A. Well, we were getting ready to leave to go
15 to the airport, and we were waiting. She and I sat
16 on the steps in the foyer. I do remember just kind
17 of asking a few questions to try to understand her
18 role, because at that point now I knew what he
19 wanted from me in the massage. And -- but she did
20 not make it clear to me that she was participating
21 in that. So I was prodding gently to see if there
22 was anything happening that shouldn't have been,
23 because I was getting the impression that she was --
24 she told me she was 17.
25 Q. She told you she was 17?

1 A. Uh-huh.
2 Q. How did that come up?
3 A. I asked her.
4 Q. Was anyone else present during this
5 conversation?
6 A. No.
7 Q. You mentioned in your earlier testimony
8 that she seemed orphan-like.
9 A. Yes.
10 Q. But you said that was something you had
11 said to Ms. McCawley, correct?
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. That was not said at the time?
14 A. Right. No. At the time I was getting an
15 impression that she did not have a family or she had
16 walked away from her family. And it seemed to me,
17 you know, they had just sort of adopted her, not as
18 a child, but they would take care of her.
19 Q. Did you observe anyone speaking to her as
20 a child, like make up your bed?
21 A. No.
22 Q. Did you observe whether she was using
23 drugs during that trip?
24 A. No.

2 another day.
3 Q. You said that the Virgin Islands were a
4 part of that second trip, as well?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. And do you remember Ghislaine being part
7 of the Virgin Islands the second time?
8 A. Yes. That's when she called -- went to
9 bed and kissed us all on the head and called us her
10 children.
11 Q. Who were the other participants in that
12 session?
13 A. That's who -- I d-on't recall who was
14 there. I want to say that was.
15 Q. But Virginia was not there?
16 A. Virginia was not there.
17 Q. Do you recall the point in time in which
18 Virginia went away?
19 A. Sort of. After the trip to New York, I
20 was given her phone number to call. And I remember
21 one time I tried to get ahold of her. Her boyfriend
22 answered. A boyfriend, I would assume, and he
23 sounded like he was high. And I couldn't find out
24 where she was. And then from there on, she was out
25 of the picture.

2 A. No.
3 Q.- Is that about the time that you started
4 seeing more frequently?
5 A. Yeah, I guess she was probably in the
6 picture more. Her and Sarah both had kind of been
7 around the most. -
8 Q. Did you observe or Sarah appearing
9 to act lik-e Jeffrey's girlfriend?

11 Q. What did you observe?
12 A. She was just very loving, kissing him.
13 Q. Did you know how old she was?
14 A. I didn't know.
15 Q. So you gave massages to Ghislaine five or
16 10 times. Was there anything unusual about those
17 massages?
18 A. No.
19 Q. You've been quoted in the press perhaps as
20 saying that she wasn't very picky?
21 A. About massage?

2 narrate what he wanted. She just wanted a massage.
3 So if that makes sense.
4 Q. She may have been naked under a towel --
5 A. Definitely.

7 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
8 THE WITNESS: Yes. Actually, I do recall
9 an instance where I was massaging her and
10 Jeffrey came into the room and he did something
11 sort of sexual to her, whether it was fondling
12 her or slapping her butt or something, and she
13 brushed him off like she was embarrassed.

3 Can I clarify?

20 photos around. I just didn't retain them in my
