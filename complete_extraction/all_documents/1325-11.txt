2 Ghislane Maxwell?
3 A. I wanted to speak with everyone related to
4 this home, including Ms. Maxwell. My contact was
5 through Gus, Attorney Gus Fronstin, at the time, who
6 initially had told me that he would make everyone
7 available for an interview. And subsequent
8 conversations later, no one was available for
9 interview and everybody had an attorney, and I was
10 not going to be able to speak with them.
11 Q. Okay. During your investigation, what did
12 you learn in terms of Ghislane Maxwell's
13 involvement, if any?
14 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
15 foundation.
16 THE WITNESS: Ms. Maxwell, during her
17 research, was found to be Epstein's long-time
18 friend. During the interviews, Ms. Maxwell was
19 involved in seeking girls to perform massages
20 and work at Epstein's home.

11 Q. And of the 30, 33 or so girls, how many
12 had massage experience?
13 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

15 THE WITNESS: I believe two of them may
16 have been -- two of them.
17 BY MR. EDWARDS:
18 Q. Okay. And as we go through this report,
19 you may remember the names?
20 A. Correct. Let me correct myself. I
21 believe only one had.
22 Q. And was that -- was that one of similar
23 age to the other girls?

4 THE WITNESS: Each of the victims that
5 went to the home were asked to bring their
6 friends to the home. Some complied and some
7 didn't.
8 BY MR. EDWARDS:
9 Q. Okay. So the victim would come to the
10 home and could give a massage and get paid for it;
11 is that right?
12 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

14 THE WITNESS: Correct.
15 BY MR. EDWARDS:
16 Q. And at the end of that massage, if that

3 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

5 THE WITNESS: Correct.
6 BY MR. EDWARDS:
7 Q. And, as well, certain people that were
8 friends or girlfriends or assistants of Jeffrey
9 Epstein would recruit girls under the pretense of
10 giving a massage?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

13 THE WITNESS: Correct.
14 BY MR. EDWARDS:
15 Q. Is that what your investigation revealed
16 in terms of the system of getting these girls over
17 to the house?
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
19 foundation.
20 THE WITNESS: Yes.
21 BY MR. EDWARDS:
22 Q. Okay. Talking about the massages, when --
23 when these -- the various girls that you interviewed
24 described the massages, was there a pattern of what
25 occurred during these massages?

5 BY MR. EDWARDS:
6 Q. Okay. Describe for us what the pattern
7 was that was told to you by the 30 or so girls that
8 you interviewed?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
10 foundation.
11 THE WITNESS: Initially, when the -- when
12 the victims would come into the home and were
13 brought upstairs to provide the massage,
14 Epstein would lay on his massage table, where
15 they would start to rub his back and the back
16 of his legs.
17 Epstein would either attempt to fondle the
18 girls or touch the girls inappropriately, and
19 at which point he would masturbate. And when
20 he was done, he would get up and go wash off
21 while the girls would get dressed and go back
22 downstairs and get paid.
23 BY MR. EDWARDS:
24 Q. Okay. So did you determine that "massage"
25 was actually a code word for something else?

2 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

4 THE WITNESS: When they went to perform a
5 massage, it was for sexual gratification.
6 BY MR. EDWARDS:
7 Q. And when the assistants would call and ask
8 these girls to work, did you learn what the term
9 "work" meant with respect to these girls coming to
10 the house?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
12 foundation.
13 THE WITNESS: "Work" meant to come and
14 provide Epstein a massage.
15 BY MR. EDWARDS:
16 Q. And massage -- how often would these
17 massages, based upon your investigation, turn into
18 something sexual?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
20 foundation.
21 THE WITNESS: During the investigation, it
22 was determined that he would have multiple
23 massages during the day. He would have some in
24 the morning and some in the afternoon,
25 sometimes into the evening. So he would

2 BY MR. EDWARDS:
3 Q. All right.
4 And so when you went to speak with the
5 victims, what did these victims say about their
6 experience with Jeffrey Epstein?
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
8 foundation.
9 THE WITNESS: Once they were recruited,
10 they were brought to the home. They were to
11 provide a massage.
12 Some of the victims did not want to be
13 touched; some of the victims did not want to
14 partake in that. So it was -- I believe for --
15 for a couple of them it was only a one-shot
16 deal, but others continued to come.
17 BY MR. EDWARDS:
18 Q. Okay. And as you interviewed some of
19 those victims, did you learn that some of those
20 victims also brought additional girls?
21 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
22 foundation.
23 THE WITNESS: That's correct.
24 BY MR. EDWARDS:

3 information from these victims and then going to
4 talk to the next person down the line, if you will?
5 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
6 foundation.
7 THE WITNESS: Correct.
8 BY MR. EDWARDS:
9 Q. And what is the purpose of that?
10 A. To identify further victims and acquire
11 additional information.
12 Q. And in doing that, were you able to
13 corroborate the accuracy of what the first victim
14 told you?
15 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and
16 foundation.
17 THE WITNESS: Correct.
18 BY MR. EDWARDS:

20 involvement with respect to the various girls?

16 BY MR. EDWARDS:

19 investigation and thereafter, were various newspaper
20 articles written about the substance of some of your
21 investigation?

5 THE WITNESS: That is correct.
6 BY MR. EDWARDS:
7 Q. And, in fact, haven't you read many of
8 these newspaper articles?

10 Q. That was not a hidden secret from the
11 public beginning in 2006, right?
12 A. No.
13 Q. And from your overall investigation, kind
14 of just a big picture, what was the criminal
15 activity, as specific as you can, that you learned
16 that Jeffrey Epstein and others were involved in?

9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

11 THE WITNESS: No, no.
12 As it became known to us that the victim
13 was recruited, brought to the home, provided
14 the massage, was paid, whether there was
15 inappropriate touching, whether there was
16 sexual activity, whether there was actually
17 intercourse, all of that was documented and was
18 asked whether they brought anyone to the home,
19 whether they had any formal training in massage
20 therapy, and once -- once additional victims
21 were identified, we continued the same -- the
22 same method of investigation.

6 THE WITNESS: Yes.

9 earliest victims that you interviewed was Haley
10 Robson; is that right?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA: Object to form and

13 THE WITNESS: It was actually SG, I think
14 was the first one that was interviewed, and
15 then HR was the one I interviewed.
16 BY MR. EDWARDS:
17 Q. Okay. My question was bad.
18 I know that the first person interviewed
19 that kind of kicked off the investigation was SG,
20 but -- and just to create a picture of what we have
21 here, this is, and tell me if I characterized it
22 wrong, a scheme that Jeffrey Epstein engaged in by
23 using assistants to recruit girls, right?
