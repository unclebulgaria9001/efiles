Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
V.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
AFFIDAVIT
I, Sarah Ransome, swear and affirm as follows:
1. I am currently over the age of 18 and presently reside in the country of Spain.
2. 1n the summer of 2006, when I was twenty-two years old and living in New York,
I was introduced to Jeffrey Epstein by a girl I had met named Natalya.
Malyshov. Shortly after meeting Jeffrey he invited me to fly to his private island
in the US Virgin Islands, which I did. After that first trip I traveled to the island
several more times, usually on one of Jeffrey's private airplanes, and always at his
direction. I am told that my name appears on the flight logs of one or more of
those trips. On a few occasions, Jeffrey also arranged to have me flown to the
island on commercial r1ights. As it turned out, the primary purpose of those visits
was to have me have sexual relations with Jeffrey, Nadia Macinkova, and various
other girls and guests he brought to the island.
3. During one ofmy visits to the island I met Ghislaine Maxwell. Watching her
interact with the other girls on the island, it became clear to me that she recruited
all or many oft hem to the island. Once they were there, she appeared to be in
charge of their activities, including what they did, who they did it with, and how
they were supposed to stay in line. She assumed the same supervisory role with
me as soon as I arrived. Some of the girls appeared to be 18 or older, but many
appeared to be young teenagers. I recall seeing a particularly young, thin girl who
looked well under 18 and recall asking her her age. I later leamed was a ballerina
She refused to tell me or let me see her passport.
4. In addition to spending time with Jeffrey on his island, I spent time with him in
New York City. At his town house I was also lent out by him to his friends and

associates to have sex. Among the people he lent me to was bis friend, Alan
Dershowitz. On one occasion I was in a bedroom at Jeffrey's New York
townhouse with Jeffrey and Nadia Marcinkova. After a short time, Alan
Dershowitz entered the room, after which Jeffrey left the room and Nadia and I
had sex with Dershowitz. I recall specific, key details of his person and the sex
acts and can describe th.em in the event it becomes necessary to do so.
I affirm under penalty of perjury that the foregoing is true and correct.
