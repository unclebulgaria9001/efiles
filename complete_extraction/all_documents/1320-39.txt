Hi Jenna,
My suggestion is for you to do a Freedom of Information Act request (www.foia.gov) for the information
you are looking for because I am not able to release information (should there be any) from FBI
records. You need to include as many details as possible so they can focus and narrow the search.
Explain that you are looking for information related to your recovery as a victim of Ron Eppinger. The
process may take some time but it is the appropriate method for you to obtain any possible records
regarding your recovery. Hope this helps.
Best wishes,
Jason

Subject: Hi There
G'day Jason,
I know I am a pain in your rear right now and I don't want to be but I am so close to wrapping up an
era, just need a couple dates confirmed is all.
If you aren't sure about the dates which you have already said that's fine. I have turned the Wilton
Manors police dept upside down looking through records and come up w nada. What was your
acquaintance's name that took my statement about Ron Eppinger? Is it possible that it wasn't Wilton
Manors and maybe it was somewhere else?
I'm really racking my brain about this!! It would be a personal favor to me and I am so very much
appreciative of anything you might know!!
Thanks a lot mate!!

Hi Jason,
Long time, no talk. I hope all has been well for you and yours!! I am now back in the USA, not too
many people know about that and I'd like to keep it that way as my case against Jeffrey Epstein has
intensified!! I am here to get this BS non- prosecution agreement thrown out and speaking w Judge
Paul Cassal he suggested trying to get ahold of any photos and/or video recordings released by the FBI
to assist our case further in proving how much pedophilia occurred by Jeffrey and the many other
monsters he obliged w underage girls. If this is a possibility please let me know so I can give you Brad
Edwards( my attorney) his contact details. Many thanks for your time and I hope we should meet again.
Kindest Regards,
Virginia Roberts

Hi Christina,
I was wondering if you remember me from Sydney Consulate, I am a victim in the investigation from
the Jeffrey Epstein case and was wondering if you could tell me if I would be able to get ahold of any
of the pics and/or videos that the FBI might have confiscated from any of Epstein's residences? Also can
I ask if you might have any of the flight logs that include my name in them to be sent to me as well.
It's all for evidential purposes and would prove a many of things to help my case.
Kindest Regards,
Virginia Roberts
