2 a witness named in the notice heretofore filed,
3 being of lawful age and having been first duly
4 sworn, testified on her oath as follows:
5 E X A M I N A T I O N
6 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
7 Q. Good morning, Johanna. Thank you for
8 coming. I'm going to talk to you a little bit about
9 the deposition process before we get started to make
10 sure you understand what's going to happen here
11 today.
12 You just heard there's a videographer, and
13 he's going to be taking your video during this
14 deposition and generally what's happening in the
15 course of the deposition.
16 And then you have a court reporter here
17 who takes down the words that we say. And it's a
18 little bit tricky because I tend to speak quickly
19 sometimes and speak over people, and she needs to
20 get down all of the words. So I'll try to do my
21 best to go slower and make sure I'm not talking over
22 you.
23 And, similarly, if you've got an answer to
24 a question, make sure that you're verbally
25 responding, not just nodding or making a gesture
MAGNA&
LEGAL SERVICES
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-12 Filed 01/03/24 Page 7 of 179
Page 6
1 because she can't get that down. We want to make
2 sure our responses are verbal. I'll try to remind
3 you of that if that happens.
4 Have you ever been deposed before?
5 A. No.
6 Q. No. Okay.
7 So what's going to happen is I'm going to
8 ask questions, and you'll give answers. And like I
9 said, everybody will be recording those.
10 Is there any reason, any medical reason,
11 anything you've taken today that would cause you to
12 not to be able to give truthful testimony today?
13 A. No.
14 Q. No. Okay.
15 All right. So we're going to get started,
16 and if you have any questions during the deposition
17 or you need to stop to take a break, you can just
18 let me know and we'll take that break.
19 So what I -- the only thing I ask is if
20 we're in the midst of a question, you finish the
21 answer before we take a break.
22 A. Sure.
23 Q. But I'll try to make sure that I take
24 regular breaks, as well.
25 You stated your name for the record. Can

1 you tell me your date of birth?
2
3 Q. That makes you how old now?
4
5 Q. Okay. And where are you currently living?
6
7 Q. And I'm going to show you what I'm going
8 to mark as the first two exhibits in the matter.
9 And I'm going to ask the court reporter if I can
10 mark those.
11 (The referred-to document was marked by
12 the court reporter for Identification as
13 Sjoberg Exhibits 1 and 2.)
14 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
15 Q. Okay. I'm going to show you what I'm
16 marking as Exhibit 1. It's going to be the
17 re-notice of your videotaped deposition, which is
18 simply a notice I'm going to show you. And then
19 Exhibit 2 is the subpoena that we served on you.
20 So you're here today pursuant to our
21 Notice of Deposition and the subpoena that we served
22 on you.
23 Are you familiar with the subpoena? Have
24 you seen that document before?
25 A. Yes.

1 Q. Okay. Great.
2 All right. Do you know a female by the
3 name of Ghislaine Maxwell?
4 A. Yes.
5 Q. And when did you first meet Ms. Maxwell?
6 A. 2001. March probably. End of
7 February/beginning of March.
8 Q. And how did you meet her?
9 A. She approached me while I was on campus at
10 Palm Beach Atlantic College.
11 Q. And what happened when she approached you?
12 A. She asked me if I could tell her how to
13 find someone that would come and work at her house.
14 She wanted to know if there was, like, a bulletin
15 board or something that she could post, that she was
16 looking for someone to hire.
17 Q. And what did you discuss with her?
18 A. I told her where she could go to -- you
19 know, to put up a listing. And then she asked me if
20 I knew anyone that would be interested in working
21 for her.
22 Q. Did she describe what that work was going
23 to be?
24 A. She explained that she lived in Palm Beach
25 and didn't want butlers because they're too stuffy.
MAGNA&
LEGAL SERVICES
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-12 Filed 01/03/24 Page 10 of 179

1 And so she just liked to hire girls to work at the
2 house, answer phones, get drinks, do the job a
3 butler would do.
4 Q. And did she tell you what she would pay
5 for that kind of a job?
6 A. At that moment, no, but later in the day,
7 yes.
8 Q. And what did she say?
9 A. Twenty dollars an hour.
10 Q. Was there anybody else with Ms. Maxwell
11 when you met her?
12 A. There was another woman with her. I don't
13 recall her or what she looks like or how old she
14 was.
15 Q. And what happened next?
16 A. And then she asked me if I would be
17 interested in working for her. And she told me that
18 she was -- I could trust her and that I could jump
19 in her car and go check out the house at that moment
20 if I wanted.
21 And so I said, Sure, let's do it, and went
22 to her home with her.
23 Q. And where was that home?
24 A. In Palm Beach.
25 Q. And did she describe that home as being

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-12 Filed 01/03/24 Page 11 of 179

1 her home?
2 A. She described it as being her home and
3 alluded to the fact that it was her and Jeffrey's
4 home and that she had homes all over the world.
5 Yes.
6 Q. And what happened when you arrived at the
7 home?
8 A. I believe she just showed me around.
9 Q. Do you recall meeting anybody at the home?
10 A. I don't recall if I met Jeffrey at that
11 time or the next time that I was there.
12 Q. How did you meet Jeffrey? Did Maxwell
13 introduce you to Jeffrey?
14 A. Yes.
15 Q. What do you recall of your first meeting
16 with Jeffrey?
17 A. I remember him being in a bathrobe. I
18 recall talking to him about how I was a major in
19 psychology. And he had studied psychology, and so
20 he spoke with me about different topics.
21 I remember thinking this guy is very
22 smart. That was my first impression.
23 Q. And when you refer to Jeffrey, are you
24 referring to Jeffrey Epstein?
25 A. Yes.

1 Q. How did the meeting -- you said Maxwell
2 took you to the home. Do you remember how that
3 meeting ended?
4 A. Well, she dropped me back off at campus.
5 Q. And did you --
6 A. She got my number and I took her number.
7 And then she called me the next weekend to work.
8 Q. So at that point you started working for
9 Ms. Maxwell?
10 A. At that time, yes.
11 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading.
12 Sorry.
13 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
14 Q. Did you then start working for Ms. Maxwell
15 after that first meeting?
16 A. She called me and I went over to the home
17 the next Sunday to work.
18 Q. And what work -- can you describe for me
19 the first day at work, what work you performed?
20 A. Sure. I remember answering the phones and
21 taking messages. And at one point, she asked me to
22 go pick up printer ink, and I took her car to Office
23 Depot to get ink.
24 She asked me to go buy some magazines, so
25 I went to Palm Beach Daily News and bought a few

1 magazines.
2 She and I went -- she wanted to take me
3 shopping to Worth Avenue, but it was a Sunday and
4 Nieman Marcus was closed, so we went back to, like,
5 a little book store. And I remember she bought, I
6 think, five pairs of reading glasses because she
7 thought Jeffrey would like them. He had them all
8 over the house. On every table there was reading
9 glasses.
10 And that's about it. It was a pretty
11 simple day.
12 Q. Were you paid that day for that work?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And how much were you paid? Do you
15 remember?
16 A. I don't remember how many hours I was
17 there -- I was there. She paid me cash.
18 Q. So Maxwell paid you?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. And then was she the one who trained you
21 with what -- with respect to what you were supposed
22 to do during the day, directed you to, like you
23 said, go to --
24 A. I believe she was the one that was kind of
25 showing me around.

1 Q. And how long did you work in that position
2 answering phones and doing --
3 A. Just that one day.
4 Q. Just that one day.
5 And did your duties change?
6 A. Well, the next time she called me, she
7 asked me if I wanted to come over and make $100 an
8 hour rubbing feet.
9 Q. And what did you think of that offer?
10 A. I thought it was fantastic.
11 Q. And did you come over to the house for
12 that purpose?
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. And when you came over to the house, was
15 Maxwell present?
16 A. I don't recall.
17 Q. And what happened that second time you
18 came to the house?
19 A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she
20 took me up to Jeffrey's bathroom and he was present.
21 And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was
22 showing me how to massage.
23 And then she -- he took -- he got off the
24 table, she got on the table. She took off her
25 clothes, got on the table, and then he was showing

1 me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes
2 off. They asked me to get on the table so I could
3 feel it. Then they both massaged me.
4 Q. So it was more than a foot massage at that
5 point?
6 A. Yeah, it was mostly, like, legs and back.
7 Q. Was everybody in the room without clothes
8 on?
9 A. When they were on the massage table, yes.
10 Q. Did they -- when they got off the massage
11 table to perform the massage, did they dress or
12 did --
13 A. Yes.
14 Q. They dressed.
15 And do you recall who paid you for that
16 first day that you did the massages?
17 A. I don't recall.
18 Q. Do you recall whether Maxwell was at the
19 house during that first day when you were doing the
20 massage with Emmy and Jeffrey?
21 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, asked and
22 answered.

2 A. Ghislaine.
3 Q. Did Maxwell ever refer to Emmy by any
4 particular term?
5 A. She called her her slave.
6 Q. You said your job duties changed. Did you
7 start to travel as part of your job with Jeffrey and
8 Ghislaine?
9 A. Yes. The next time they called me, they
10 asked me to go to New York.
11 Q. And did you -- do you recall when that was
12 approximately?
13 A. That was Easter of 2001.
14 Q. And do you recall who was on the plane

2 going to see a date of April 2001.
3 I'm just going to ask you to go down to
4 the -- if you look at the line on the left to where
5 it says 9 for the date, and look over where it has
6 the names.
7 Do you see -- can you identify your name
8 on that list?
9 A. Yes.

2 reading the document.
3 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
4 Q. And do you recall where you flew when you
5 went to -- when you traveled that first time with
6 Jeffrey Epstein?
7 A. We left from Palm Beach and landed in
8 Atlantic City for a few hours because there was a
9 storm in New York, and then got back on the plane a
10 few hours later and landed in Teterboro.
11 Q. And you said that you recall landing in
12 Atlantic City. Did you go into Atlantic City?
13 A. Yes, went to one of Trump's casinos.
14 Q. Did you actually go into the casino
15 itself?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Do you recall Virginia -- at the time
18 Virginia Roberts being present with you?
19 A. Yes.
20 Q. Do you recall if she went into the casino?
21 A. She was underage. I did not know anything
22 about how old you had to be to gamble legally. I
23 just knew she could not get in because of an ID
24 issue. So she and I did not gamble.
25 Q. In your opinion, did Virginia look young,

LEGAL SERVICES
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-12 Filed 01/03/24 Page 20 of 179

1 in your view?
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Did you ever -- did you at that time
4 wonder why she was traveling with Jeffrey?
5 A. At that time, I did not.
6 Q. Did you later wonder that?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And what was your impression?
9 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, vague,
10 speculative.
11 THE WITNESS: I -- we're jumping ahead; is
12 that okay?
13 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
14 Q. Yes, that's okay.
15 A. A few days later, I remember asking her
16 questions to try to figure out her role, why she was
17 there, and she gave me vague answers and was never
18 specific.
19 And so I thought perhaps she just was an
20 assistant, someone that did massages well. I wanted
21 to believe that she was innocent.
22 Q. Did you ever refer to her as being
23 orphan-like?
24 A. I did.
25 Q. And how did that come about?
MAGNA&
LEGAL SERVICES
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-12 Filed 01/03/24 Page 21 of 179
Page 20
1 A. No, I only -- to you, I said that to you.
2 I just saw her as perhaps someone who may not have
3 had a strong family, and they took her under their
4 wing.
5 Q. Now, you mentioned remembering going to
6 Atlantic City.
7 Did you go -- where did you go after
8 Atlantic City?
9 A. Once we landed in New York, Emmy and I
10 went in a car and drove around the city for a half
11 hour or so, just to see some of the city.
12 Q. And then where did you go after doing the
13 sightseeing?
14 A. We went to the townhouse on East 71st.
15 Q. And can you describe that location for me?
16 A. Sure. Between Madison and Park. I think
17 the address might have been 9 East 71st Street.
18 Q. And who owned that home?
19 A. As far as I knew, Epstein.
20 Q. Can you describe for me physically what --
21 A. Palatial. When you walk up, it looks like
22 a normal door to a townhouse, and when you walk
23 in -- I thought there were four floors. I heard
24 there were seven floors. I didn't see them all.
25 Q. And do you recall who, if anybody, was at

Page 21
1 Jeffrey's home when you arrived?
2 A. Yes. When I first walked in the door, it
3 was just myself, and Ghislaine headed for the
4 staircase and said -- told me to come up to the
5 living room.
6 Q. And what happened at that point, when you
7 came up to the living room?
8 A. I came up and saw Virginia, Jeffrey,
9 Prince Andrew, Ghislaine in the room.
10 Q. And did you meet Prince Andrew at that
11 time?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And what happened next?
14 A. At one point, Ghislaine told me to come
15 upstairs, and we went into a closet and pulled out
16 the puppet, the caricature of Prince Andrew, and
17 brought it down. And there was a little tag on the
18 puppet that said "Prince Andrew" on it, and that's
19 when I knew who he was.
20 Q. And did -- what did the puppet look like?

20 And I asked her what school she went to,
21 kind of prodding to see if she went to one of the
22 area colleges, and I did not recognize the name of
23 the school.

1 Q. And what -- do you recall any observations
2 about when you met her?
3 A. To speak with, she was a little rough
4 around the edges, and I could see the progression of
5 her being groomed a little. They got her braces.
6 She had terrible posture. And with a lot of
7 massages, she learned to stand up straight. So I
8 just saw her become a much more confident person.
9 Q. Do you recall how old she was when you
10 first met her?

1 A. I want to say it was early 2006 or late
2 2005.
3 Q. Do you recall who you met with?
4 A. No.
5 Q. Do you recall what you told the police?
6 A. It was similar to this. They were asking
7 me a lot of questions that I answered. They knew a
8 lot. They knew what the bathroom looked like. They
9 knew that the couch had a hot pink throw on it with
10 green tassels.
11 I assumed that there had been videos and
12 they had seen me. They had seen the videos. That's
13 what I had assumed. I didn't know that maybe people
14 had already come forward and given them statements.
15 Q. Did they talk to you at all about the
16 videos?
17 A. They said, Were you aware that there were
18 video cameras in the house?

5 Q. I'm just going to ask that you take a look
6 at that. As you can see, under the narrative line
7 there, there is a name. It says, "Reported by
8 Recarey, Joseph." Is that a name you recall meeting
9 with, a Detective Recarey?
10 A. Yes. I mean, I don't recall his name,
11 only except that he had been following me around,
12 and he left me cards, like, on my car and in my
13 door. I tried to avoid him for a long time.
14 Q. And can you just look at the text
15 underneath there?
16 A. Uh-huh.
17 Q. Take a moment to look at that.
18 A. Sure.
19 Q. Does that refresh your recollection as to
20 what you told the police during the investigation?
21 A. There are errors in here. I was not 23
22 when I met him. I was 21.
23 Q. Anything else that doesn't look correct?
24 A. The same error: That I had met him three
25 years ago, and it obviously had been closer to five.

1 There is also the error, he obviously
2 misunderstood me: He did not pay for my tuition at
3 college. I'm still paying those school loans. But
4 he did pay for me to go to massage school and to
5 cosmetology school.

23 And she asked me about -- she had a house
24 in Palm Beach, and she was looking for someone that
25 she could hire to work at the house, where she could

1 post that she needed help.
2 She then asked me if I knew anyone, and I
3 didn't know who she was, I didn't want to take the
4 responsibility of finding someone to work for her,
5 and so I said, Sorry, I don't.
6 And then she said, Well, maybe what about
7 you?
8 And I was at a point in life, I was super
9 spontaneous and willing to skip school.
10 So she said, Come to my house, come in my
11 car and check it out.
12 And so I did.
13 Q. Okay. So for those of you -- of us who
14 don't know, is this like a college campus, like a
15 traditional college campus, or is it in a city
16 setting?
17 A. It's in a city setting. I mean, Palm
18 Beach is not a big city. So it's on the
19 Intracoastal, and there was a big grassy area that
20 were surrounded by buildings, so she was inside of
21 the campus.
22 Q. And she was looking for a bulletin board
23 where she could post a job?
24 A. Something like that, yes.
25 Q. Did she have any kind of flyers --

9 conversation; is that fair?
10 A. Yes.

12 personality?
13 A. Well, I instantly picked up on the fact
14 that she was British. She had on, like, workout
15 clothes. I believe she was wearing all black. And
16 she -- I mean, she was a little snarky, but I felt
17 comfortable enough to get in the car with her.
18 Q. And it sounds like you had contact with
19 her over the next several years; is that fair?
20 A. Yes.
21 Q. And did you get to know more about her
22 personality over those five years, four or five
23 years?

2 A. Sure. She definitely had a great sense of
3 humor, she loved making jokes. I mean, in a very
4 British way. I don't remember her ever laughing,
5 but she was funny.
6 And I remember just thinking, she -- the
7 first weekend that we flew to the Virgin Islands,
8 she flew the helicopter from Saint, wherever we were
9 to little Saint Jeff [sic] or whatever the name of
10 the island was, and I just thought, wow, who is this

21 Beach?
22 A. Sure. It's at the end of El Brillo Way,
23 on the Intracoastal. The house was either white or
24 pink. It was pink at one time it may have been

16 Yeah.
17 Q. And you were going for the purposes of
18 checking out potentially working at this job?

20 Q. It sounds like you met Jeffrey Epstein
21 that first time that you did go to the house, right?

2 Q. Okay. And tell me about your first
3 meeting with him.
4 A. Sure. I met him, I believe it was in the
5 hallway right beside the kitchen. There was a
6 hallway. It was actually more like a room, a pantry
7 type of room. That's where all of the pieces of
8 paper with the phone messages would lay.
9 And I remember sitting on the counter and
10 speaking with him, and he was in a bathrobe, and he
11 spoke with me about me being in college and studying
12 psychology.

1 point, You might get a massage today. That was --
2 sorry, that was the second time when I was in the
3 home working. And I just thought it was crazy that
4 I would get a massage while I was working. But it
5 did not end up happening because the masseuse could
6 not stay.
7 Q. Do you know who the masseuse was that
8 could not stay?
9 A. No.

11 meeting; you believe that was the second meeting?

16 A. Okay. Well, after that -- I remember
17 actually that day of working, I sat with Ghislaine
18 outside on this -- outside table on the patio by the
19 pool. I told her that I was getting ready to go to
20 Nicaragua for spring break on a mission trip. I
21 remember her going, Why would you ever go to
22 Nicaragua? So I was going to be gone the next week
23 for spring break.
24 So she called, after I returned, and asked
25 if I wanted to make $100 an hour rubbing feet.

1 Q. Was that the whole conversation?
2 A. That was pretty much it. I said, Okay,
3 sure, tell me when.
4 Q. And were you excited about the prospect of
5 rubbing feet and making $100?
6 A. I was actually with -- while I was on the
7 trip in Nicaragua, I was rubbing feet, I was
8 massaging people, their feet. So it just seemed
9 kind of crazy that it all happened at the same time.
10 Q. How was it rubbing feet?
11 A. I guess I just liked doing it. I didn't
12 know that I did, but I was massaging people's feet.
13 Q. Were these strangers?
14 A. No, no, no. They were -- it was a group
15 of us that went on the trip. So we were all very
16 close.
17 Q. What kind of trip was it?
18 A. It was a -- well, a PBA, you had to do
19 these things called Workship hours, which you had to
20 do community service, 40 hours every year. And so
21 that was the way to do them all, and you would go on
22 these trips and help build a school or feed children
23 or do some sort of -- something nice.
24 Q. Nice.
25 What other trips did you take while you

18 Q. And do you know how you got there?
19 A. No.
20 Q. Do you know what you were wearing?

1 because she was my main contact, and so I would
2 assume that she was probably at the house and
3 greeted me; however, I do not recall if she was
4 there.
5 Q. It sounds like you met Emmy Taylor?
6 A. Yes.
7 Q. How did you meet Emmy Taylor?
8 A. She was at the house the first day that I
9 worked running errands. And I realized she was also
10 a personal assistant type of person.
11 Q. Do you know who she worked for?
12 A. She, well, Ghislaine, it appeared to me
13 that she worked for Ghislaine. Ghislaine sort of
14 told her what to do and where to go.
15 Q. And I believe you mentioned she called her
16 her slave?
17 A. She did. It was in a joking way, but she
18 said, Yes, that's my slave.
19 Q. You did not see her in any type of slavery
20 situation?
21 A. Not any chains or anything of the sort,
22 no.

3 Q. I'm sorry. You're right. Third time.
4 The second time you went to work, but the third time
5 you were there.
6 A. Correct.
7 So I was escorted up to the bathroom,
8 which is where 99 percent of the massages happened.
9 And Emmy Taylor was with me and Jeffrey. And I
10 don't remember the order, but Emmy was on the table
11 at one point. She took all of her clothes off, got
12 on the table.
13 I remember thinking, Okay, she's just
14 going to strip naked and get on the table. Well,
15 that's cool. We're cool. That's what we do.
16 And Jeffrey was showing me how to massage
17 on her body. And then I took my clothes off and got
18 on the table, and then they showed me what it felt
19 like with the both of them.
20 And then Jeffrey got on the table and Emmy
21 showed me how to massage.
22 Q. So Ghislaine was not in the room?

2 places of the house at all?
3 A. Did I see any? No, besides us maybe
4 hanging out on the couch and someone massaging his
5 foot or me massaging his foot. But not, like, on a
6 table.

15 Q. So when you were being trained by Emmy and
16 Jeffrey on some massage techniques, did anyone say
17 anything sexual during that conversation?

11 massages that you gave him under similar

20 had no idea -- I didn't know anything sexual was
21 happening at all. So I just felt like she was just

19 And then when you got into Manhattan, how
20 did it come to be that you were doing some
21 sightseeing?
22 A. Well, they knew that I had never been, so

13 And I knew it was Prince Andrew because I had
14 recognized him as a person. I didn't know who he
15 was.
16 And so when I saw the tag that said Prince
17 Andrew, then it clicked. I'm like, that's who it
18 is.

1 something. That's all I recall.
2 Q. Did you go anywhere with Virginia?
3 A. Oh, my gosh, yes. We went to Phantom of
4 the Opera.
5 Q. Who else went?
6 A. I think it was just she and I. I forgot
7 about that. Thank you for that memory.
8 Q. It's my job.
9 Anything else you remember about that day
10 in New York?
11 A. No.
12 Q. You said you had given a massage to
13 Jeffrey while you were there on that trip or was it
14 a subsequent trip?
15 A. That trip.
16 Q. And how did that come to be?
17 A. Either he or somebody asked me to go and
18 do it. Someone showed me to the room, but I don't
19 remember who it was.
20 Q. Can you describe that room?
21 A. Yes. It was high ceilings, dark. There
22 were, like, dark red walls or dark blue walls or
23 dark blue carpeting or something. It had a massage
24 table set up in the middle, and there was a large --

2 Q. Pornographic or artistic?
3 A. No. No, I wouldn't say pornographic.
4 Artistic.
5 Q. Artistic.
6 Was Ghislaine present during that massage?
7 A. No.
8 Q. Did something about that particular
9 massage session stand out to you?
10 A. Yes. That was when I was first asked to
11 squeeze and rub his nipples while he pleasured
12 himself.
13 Q. And did he say that's what he was going to
14 do?
15 A. He -- yes, he was just very blunt about
16 it. He said, Rub my nipples, I'm going to jerk off.
17 I was like, No, done.
18 Q. And you walked out?
19 A. I did.
20 Q. Were there any repercussions of you
21 walking out?
22 A. Amazingly, no. Knowing what I know now,
23 I'm surprised I was ever called back. But, no, I
24 just stood my ground and walked out. I'm not
25 comfortable with that.

1 Q. Do you know personally whether anyone else
2 had said no to him?
3 A. No.
4 Q. Did anyone ever tell you that they had
5 been in a massage scenario and told him no?
6 A. No.
7 Q. Do you recall when in your trip the
8 massage occurred?
9 A. Well, it was not the day we landed. It
10 must have been that next day that we were there.
11 Q. Do you remember anything else about
12 Virginia from that trip other than the Prince Andrew
13 thing and Phantom of the Opera?
14 A. Well, we were getting ready to leave to go
15 to the airport, and we were waiting. She and I sat
16 on the steps in the foyer. I do remember just kind
17 of asking a few questions to try to understand her
18 role, because at that point now I knew what he
19 wanted from me in the massage. And -- but she did
20 not make it clear to me that she was participating
21 in that. So I was prodding gently to see if there
22 was anything happening that shouldn't have been,
23 because I was getting the impression that she was --
24 she told me she was 17.
25 Q. She told you she was 17?

8 that she seemed orphan-like.

10 Q. But you said that was something you had
11 said to Ms. McCawley, correct?
12 A. Correct.
13 Q. That was not said at the time?
14 A. Right. No. At the time I was getting an
15 impression that she did not have a family or she had
16 walked away from her family. And it seemed to me,
17 you know, they had just sort of adopted her, not as
18 a child, but they would take care of her.
19 Q. Did you observe anyone speaking to her as
20 a child, like make up your bed?

3 York, that might be something that he would do?
4 A. I never asked him to do anything for me,
5 but I told him I was interested in something, and he
6 always offered.
7 Q. The second trip to New York, anything
8 memorable about that? The one -- I'm sorry, the one

14 that trip or not?
15 A. I remember her being in New Mexico.

18 A. I remember she took me to -- when they
19 were building the ranch, they had a little
20 three-bedroom home, just like a prefab house. She
21 took me over there. So we went for a little walk.
22 I remember she had two new puppies named
23 Max and Mini, little Yorkies. And I want to say
24 that it was around Jeffrey's birthday when we were
25 there, but nothing -- there was no, like,

4 part of that second trip, as well?

21 one time I tried to get ahold of her. Her boyfriend
22 answered. A boyfriend, I would assume, and he
23 sounded like he was high. And I couldn't find out
24 where she was. And then from there on, she was out
25 of the picture.

13 Q. And did you engage in sexual contact with

5 Q. And this was back in 2007 or so?

7 Q. As you sit here today, does that make
8 it -- does that refresh your recollection that
9 Virginia was sitting in one chair and you were
10 sitting on another, with Andrew?

3 Ghislaine?
4 A. That Ghislaine recruited her.
5 Q. Do you know anything else that Virginia
6 said about Ghislaine?
7 A. Only what was spoken to me.
8 Q. And I should clarify. Don't tell me
9 anything your lawyer has conveyed to you.
10 A. Exactly. That's all I know. I've met

2 Dershowitz was saying nothing was happening and
3 he was calling her a liar. And she was just
4 trying to find people to back up her story.
5 BY MS. MENNINGER:
6 Q. And what did you understand her story to
7 be? Did she tell you?

9 sexual massages, and have sex with people such as
10 Dershowitz and Andrew. But I knew none of that at
11 the time.

1 believed her side of the story.
2 Q. And did she tell you what her side of the
3 story was?
4 A. You know, just that she wasn't a liar;
5 that, you know, she was there to have sex with men
6 that Jeffrey wanted her to sleep with.
7 Q. Did she tell you in that meeting who she
8 had sex with?
9 A. No.
10 Q. Did she name any of the famous people?
11 A. Only Dershowitz came up.
12 Q. Did you two talk about the incident in New
13 York with the puppet?

15 Q. And you formed this opinion about whether
16 she was a liar based on things that you've read in
17 the police report?
18 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
19 THE WITNESS: I formed my opinion based on
20 my experience in the house.
21 BY MS. MENNINGER:
22 Q. Okay. And what experience in the house
23 helped you form your opinion that what Virginia is
24 saying is true?
25 A. You know, Jeffrey being open with me about

1 what other girls did for him and that I was not one
2 of those girls.
3 He was always trying to recruit me almost
4 in a way that I could be one of them and travel with
5 him and live the life of luxury if I only -- if only
6 I did this.
7 So after five years of learning what was
8 happening, I can look back knowing -- I only knew
9 Virginia for a very short time. Looking back, I can
10 make assumptions about what was required of her.
11 Q. Did she tell you how old she was when she

1 recall saying that.
2 And there's another part in here where she
3 said I said that I made a deal with the devil, which
4 I never would have said that. The words she used.
5 Q. On page 2 of 8, it's about -- it's about
6 even with the hem of your skirt.
7 A. "I made a pack with the devil in exchange
8 for excitement and glamour. I was only a college
9 student. I was hard-up and foolish."
10 That I never said, any of that. I was a

5 A. At his house in Palm Beach. At Jeffrey's
6 house in Palm Beach.

8 A. I did not.
9 Q. Anybody else you remember? I know you

13 never had a massage before you started working with
14 Jeffrey and Ghislaine; is that correct?
15 A. I don't recall having a massage before
16 then.
17 Q. And I think you said on the first day,
18 when you were doing the clerical work, Maxwell
19 mentioned that you might be able to get a massage;
20 is that correct?
21 A. Yes.
22 Q. Did you tell Maxwell that you had never
23 had a massage at that point?

1 had never had a massage?
2 A. No.
3 Q. And then you were talking about the
4 massage -- the first massage when you were being in
5 the room with Jeffrey and Emmy?
6 A. Uh-huh.
7 Q. And I know you said Emmy was naked or took
8 off her clothes at some point?
9 A. Uh-huh.
10 Q. And then laid on the table.
11 And then you changed positions with her;
12 is that what happened?
13 A. Yes. I don't remember the sequence, but
14 at one point she was, I was, and Jeffrey was.
15 Q. And in the -- in the time when there was
16 changeover, for example, when you're on the table
17 and Emmy is not on the table and Jeffrey is not on
18 the table, did Emmy at that point remain naked or
19 did she actually stop and get dressed and continue
20 massaging?
21 A. I don't recall her getting dressed, but I
22 would probably remember if she massaged naked.
23 Q. Do you know if Jeffrey remained naked
24 during that massage?
25 A. He was never, like, naked standing up. He

1 always covered himself with a towel.
2 Q. I believe I asked this, but I just want to
3 clarify to make sure that I did: Did Maxwell ever
4 ask you to bring other girls over to -- for Jeffrey?
5 A. Yes.
6 Q. Yes?
7 A. Yes.
8 Q. And what did you -- did you do anything in
9 response to that?
10 A. I did bring one girl named --
11 no. -- it was some girl named
12 that I had worked with at a restaurant. And I
13 recall Ghislaine giving me money to bring her over;
14 however, they never called her to come.
15 Q. And then I believe you mentioned that one
16 of your physical fitness instructors, you brought a
17 physical fitness instructor; was that correct?
18 A. Correct.
19 Q. And what did she do?
20 A. She gave him a -- like a training session,
21 twice.
22 Q. Twice.
23 Did anything sexual in nature happen

1 exposed her bra, and she grabbed it and pulled it
2 down.
3 Q. Anything else?
4 A. That was the conversation that he had told
5 her that he had taken this girl's virginity, the
6 girl by the pool.
7 Q. Okay. Did Maxwell ever say to you that it
8 takes the pressure off of her to have other girls
9 around?
10 A. She implied that, yes.
11 Q. In what way?
12 A. Sexually.
13 Q. And earlier Laura asked you, I believe, if
14 Maxwell ever asked you to perform any sexual acts,
15 and I believe your testimony was no, but then you
16 also previously stated that during the camera
17 incident that Maxwell had talked to you about not
18 finishing the job.
19 Did you understand "not finishing the job"
20 meaning bringing Jeffrey to orgasm?
21 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.
22 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
23 Q. I'm sorry, Johanna, let me correct that
24 question.
25 What did you understand Maxwell to mean

2 respect to the camera?
3 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.
4 THE WITNESS: She implied that I had not
5 brought him to orgasm.
6 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
7 Q. So is it fair to say that Maxwell expected
8 you to perform sexual acts when you were massaging
9 Jeffrey?
10 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form,
11 foundation.
12 THE WITNESS: I can answer?
13 Yes, I took that conversation to mean that
14 is what was expected of me.
15 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
16 Q. And then you mentioned, I believe, when
17 you were testifying earlier that Jeffrey told you a
18 story about sex on the plane. What was that about?
19 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, hearsay.
20 THE WITNESS: He told me one time Emmy was
21 sleeping on the plane, and they were getting
22 ready to land. And he went and woke her up,
23 and she thought that meant he wanted a blow
24 job, so she started to unzip his pants, and he
25 said, No, no, no, you just have to be awake for

4 on the plane?
5 A. No.
6 Q. Did Emmy ever talk to you about performing
7 sexual acts on the plane?
8 A. No.
9 Q. We looked earlier at the police report,
10 and I just want to clarify, you identified some
11 areas where there were discrepancies in that report.
12 And you can take another look at it if you
13 want, but other than the discrepancies you pointed
14 out, is that a recollection of what you remember
15 telling the detective?
16 A. Yes.
17 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, outside the
18 scope of cross.
19 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
20 Q. You mentioned that there was a time when
21 you noticed that Maxwell was around a little bit
22 less?

2 was year-wise?
3 A. I don't. I would say it was probably
4 sometime between 2003 and 2004.
5 Q. And what made you think that?
6 A. I just saw her less and less at the house.
7 Q. Were you there more at the house during
8 that time period?
9 A. No, not necessarily. It's just at the
10 beginning, she was around a lot. And then I would
11 see her occasionally without him. The one time we
12 spent a few days together in 2006, she wasn't there
13 at all.

3 those?
4 A. He did.
5 Q. And when we were talking about the Palm
6 Beach house and you were describing an area where
7 there were just a lot of photographs, is it fair to
8 say that there could have been nude photographs
9 amongst those photos that you saw?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And earlier you testified that you don't
12 have knowledge of what happens behind closed doors,
13 but you also said that Jeffrey had told you what
14 other girls did for him and that he wanted you to do

3 of yourself or just a photograph of yourself?
4 A. A nude photograph of myself.
5 Q. What exactly did she say to you?
6 A. I don't remember exactly, but I know that

8 taking photos of myself, my face, but I knew I was

10 photos of my body. And I also didn't know how to
11 take a photo from standing behind. You have to have
12 someone else involved.
13 Q. That's my question. How would you take a
14 nude photograph of yourself?
15 A. Exactly. Someone else would have to do
16 it.
17 Q. Do you recall any of the particulars of

19 wanted you to do that?

10 myself.
11 Q. What did you say?
12 A. I don't remember saying no, but I never
13 ended up following through. I think I tried once.
14 Q. This was the pre-selfie era, correct?
15 A. Exactly.
16 Q. I want to go back to this: You testified
