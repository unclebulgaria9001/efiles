PLAINTIFF'S SEALED AGREED MOTION TO FILE MOTION TO COMPEL THE
PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN
UNDER SEAL PURSUANT TO LOCAL RULE 5.4(b) AND MOTION TO PLACE THE
ENTIRE DOCKET UNDER SEAL
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits
this Unopposed Motion to file her Motion to Compel the Production of Documents and
Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein under Seal Pursuant to Local Rule 5.4(b) and Motion to Place
the Entire Docket Under Seal, and hereby states as follows.
I. FACTUAL BACKGROUND
The motion to compel seeks to compel production pursuant to a valid Rule 45 subpoena
issued to Jeffrey Epstein in the above-styled case, pending in the Southern District of New York
(the "New York case"). The case concerns a defamation action brought by a child victim of
convicted pedophile Jeffrey Epstein against his live-in girlfriend who assisted him in procuring
underage girls, including the plaintiff, Ms. Giuffre. Because of Epstein's central role in the New
York case, it is important for Ms. Giuffre to have the requested documents from him in
discovery.
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 4 of 43
During his deposition, Epstein failed to answer questions or produce documents in
response to a Rule 45 subpoena in the New York case. The instant motion seeks to compel
production from Epstein in three areas, detailed more fully in the Motion to Compel, based on
his improper invocation of the Fifth Amendment in refusing to comply with the subpoena.
Epstein's invocation of the Fifth Amendment was invalid for several reasons, as discussed in
detail in the Motion to Compel. One of those reasons, however, goes to the instant request to file
the motion to compel under seal and to place the docket under seal. In should be noted that the
entire deposition of Epstein is confidential, having been placed under the confidentiality order
that exists in the case.
II. LEGAL ARGUMENT
The parties agree this case should be placed under seal because of the need for
confidentiality. There is no valid invocation of the Fifth Amendment when there is no threat to
self-incrimination, and there can be no threat to self-incrimination if the government is not aware
of the information Ms. Giuffre seeks pursuant to her valid Rule 45 subpoena. Because Ms.
Giuffre seeks to have all of the relevant proceedings to her motion to compel -including the
motion itself -be placed under seal at this time, the Government will not be aware of Epstein's
disclosure of materials, much less be in position to even file a motion to attempt alter the
protective order. In such circumstances, Epstein faces no "real and substantial hazard" of his act
of producing documents to Ms. Giuffre' s counsel incriminating himself. See United States v.
Kowalik, 809 F. Supp. 1571, 1577 (S.D. Fla. 1992), afj'd, 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993), and ajj'd,
12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993). Accordingly, by placing this case under seal, this Court can grant
Ms. Giuffre's motion to compel and direct Epstein to produce the relevant documents over his
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 5 of 43
improper Fifth Amendment objections because there is no risk of incrimination because these
proceedings will be under seal.
Moreover, under the Protective Order issued by the New York case, Ms. Giuffre's
counsel (and counsel for Ms. Maxwell,1 the Defendant in the New York case) are forbidden to
disclose the materials for "any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case." Protective
Order,~ 4. Under the terms of the protective order, all materials secured in the case will be
destroyed at the end of tl1e case. Protective Order,~ 12. And while the Protective Order does
not bar the use of confidential materials at trial, Protective Order~ 13, Ms. Giuffre's counsel
represent that they will not use at trial any documents that Epstein produces without first
notifying Epstein and seeking leave of Court to do so. As a result, Epstein can provide
documents to Ms. Giuffre, allowing her to investigate this case without compromising any
interest that Epstein may have in avoiding self-incrimination.
Additionally, the entire deposition has already been designated as "confidential" by
defendant Maxwell, making these proceedings subject to a protective order. See Motion to
Compel at Addendum A (copy of protective order). To enforce that previously-entered
confidentiality order from the Southern District of New York, these proceedings should be
confidential as well. Moreover, in such circumstances, there is no substantial risk of
incrimination from the mere production of documents to Ms. Giuffre's counsel, who are subject
to the protective order. See generally Marc Youngelson, The Use of2 6(c) Protective Orders:
"Pleading the Fifth" Without Suffering "Adverse" Consequences, 1994 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 245
(1995); see also Palmieri v. State ofNew York, 779 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1985).
1 It may be relevant to note that defendant Maxwell has not sought any documents from Epstein,
and thus the only issue presented here is the extent to which Ms. Giuffre can use the documents.
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 6 of 43
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 authorizes a court, for good cause, to enter a
protective order to seal or to limit disclosure. Indeed, courts have the discretion to place entire
cases under seal. See e.g. Beaches MLS, Inc. v. Miami Association ofR ealtors, Inc., 2015 WL
11170925, at *3 (S.D.Fla. 2015) (Marra, J.) (granting motion to file under seal and sealing the
case). Local Rule 5 .4(b) provides the procedure to follow when a party seeks to file something
under seal: the party must file a motion, "setting forth a reasonable basis for departing from the
general policy of a public filing," and courts in this district routinely grant parties' motions to file
under seal for good cause. See e.g. Shire Development LLC v. Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc., 932
F.Supp.2d 1349, 1359 (S.D.Fla. 2013) (Middlebrooks, J.); Air Turbine Technology, Inc. v. Atlas
Copco AB, 2003 WL 22939256, at* 1 (S.D.Fla. 2003) (Marra, J.).
Ms. Giuffre has articulated good cause to grant her motion to file under seal and to seal
this case, as it would facilitate the execution of a valid Rule 45 subpoena issued upon Jeffrey
Epstein and follow the confidentiality order previously entered in this case by the U.S. District
Court for the Southern District of New York. Counsel for Ms. Giuffre has conferred with counsel
for Epstein, and counsel for Epstein has agreed to the filing of the Motion to Compel under seal.
III. CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, respectfully requests that the
Court grant her Agreed Motion to file her Motion to Compel the Production of Documents and
Testimony from Jeffrey Epstein under Seal Pursuant to Local Rule 5.4(b) and Motion to Place
the Entire Docket Under Seal for the reasons set forth above.

PLAINTIFF'S SEALED MOTION TO COMPEL THE PRODUCTION OF
DOCUMENTS AND TESTIMONY FROM JEFFREY EPSTEIN
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, respectfully submits
this motion to compel Jeffrey Epstein to produce documents and testimony in response to his
repeated invocations of the Fifth Amendment at his recent deposition.
This motion seeks to compel production from Epstein in three areas. First, at his
deposition, Epstein asserted that the Fifth Amendment allowed him to decline to produce any
documents whatsoever. Epstein has the burden of demonstrating the applicability of the Fifth
Amendment privilege, and he cannot carry that burden. He should be required to produce
documents or, at the very least, a privilege log so that the Court (and opposing counsel) can
assess the validity of his claims.
Second, Epstein was asked approximately 500 hundred substantive questions at his
deposition, and he took the Fifth rather than answer even a single one of them (other than the
question about his name). Some of the questions he refused to answer pose no substantial risk of
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 12 of 43
incrimination. He should be ordered to answer these specific questions, which are enumerated in
Section II, below.
Third, Epstein also took the Fifth when asked questions about Ghislaine Maxwell's
interactions with females overseas. Maxwell was Epstein's live-in girlfriend who assisted him in
procuring underage girls. The Supreme Comt has made clear that a Fifth Amendment privilege
cannot be asserted with respect to incrimination in a foreign crime. And certainly Epstein has no
Fifth Amendment privilege involving sex crimes committed by another person. Epstein should
be ordered to answer specific questions identified in Section III, below about Maxwell's actions
in foreign countries.
FACTUAL BACKGROUND
1. Ms. Giuffre has filed a defamation action in the Southern District of New York
against Ghislaine Maxwell. In brief, Ms. Giuffre alleges that defendant Ms. Ghislaine Maxwell
defamed her by calling her a "liar" for filing documents alleging that Maxwell and her boyfriend,
Jeffrey Epstein, had sexually abused her and trafficked her for sexual purposes. See Mccawley
Deel., Exhibit 1 (c omplaint in GiufFe v. Maxwell).
2. As discovery in this case has proceeded, Defendant initially suggested she would
take the Fifth and refuse to answer questions. During her deposition, however, Defendant did
not take the Fifth. Instead, she testified that she suffered from a series of memory lapses and
could not recall many of the key issues in dispute in this case. For example, at her deposition,
Defendant indicated that she lacked recollection of or was otherwise unable to specifically
answer the following questions:1
• Whether Defendant observed a female under the age of 18 at Jeffrey Epstein's
home in Palm Beach. See McCawley Deel., Ex. 2 (Maxwell Depa.) at 29;
1 Maxwell has designated the entire contents of her deposition as confidential pursuant to the
Protective Order entered in that case, and, therefore, the contents must be filed under seal.
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 13 of 43
• Whether Defendant had meet Ms. Giuffre and introduced her to Epstein. Id. at
33;
• Whether massage therapists at Epstein's mansions performed sexual acts. Id. at
52-54.
• Whether Defendant was ever present to view Ms. Giuffre massaging Epstein. Id.
at 75;
• Whether Defendant could recall Ms. Giuffre staying at any of Epstein's six
homes. Id. at 81.
• Whether Defendant remembered taking a trip with Ms. Giuffre to travel over to
Europe, including London. Id. at 108.
• Whether Defendant ever flew on one of Epstein's planes with a 17 year old. Id. at
121-22.
• Whether the notation "GM" on flight logs for passengers on Epstein's planes
represented the Defendant (i.e., Ghislaine Maxwell). Id. at 122-23.
• Whether Defendant could recall ever being on a flight on one of Epstein's planes
with Ms. Giuffre. Id. at 132-33.
• Whether Defendant could explain why a minor would be calling Epstein to say
they had a female for him. Id. at 164.
• Whether Defendant was aware of any interstate or international transportation of
women, aged 18 to 28, for purposes of having sex with Epstein where they would
receive compensation. Id. at 278-79.
• Whether Defendant could recall interacting with anyone, other than Ms. Giuffre,
under the age of 18 on any of Epstein's properties. Id. at 384.
See Mccawley Deel. at Exhibit 2.
3. As this Court is aware from another pending case, Epstein is a registered sex
offender who entered into a non-prosecution agreement (NP A), barring his prosecution for
federal crime for his sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre and multiple other victims. Several of
Epstein's sexual abuse victims have filed a suit alleging that they were not properly notified of
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 14 of 43
the NP A and the associated guilty plea that Epstein entered. The victims allege that Epstein
sexually abused them and that the Government violated their rights under the Crime Victims'
Rights Act (CVRA), 18 U.S.C. 3771, by not conferring with them about the deal that the
Government reached with Epstein on that sex abuse. The case is currently pending. See Jane
Does v. United States; No. 9:08-c-v-80736, DE 361 (S.D. Fla.).
4. Because of Epstein's central role in the sexual abuse of Ms. Giuffre, Ms. Giuffre
has long been attempting to depose him in the action. Epstein, who is generally regarded as
having vast financial resources, evaded those efforts to be served. Accordingly, on May 25,
2016, Ms. Giuffre sought leave to serve Epstein by alternative means. Giuffre v. Maxwell, No.
1: 15-cv-07433, DE 160 (S.D.N.Y.). Shortly thereafter, Epstein agreed through counsel to
voluntarily appear for a deposition.
5. On August 25, 2016, Ms. Giuffre served a subpoena on Epstein through his
counsel. See McCawiey Deel., Exhibit 3 (Epstein subpoena). The document sought production
of 22 categories of documents directly linked to the underlying lawsuit. For example, request for
production ("RFP") 1 sought all photographs of Epstein in the presence of either Ms. Giuffre or
Ms. Maxwell. RFP 6 sought Epstein's documents relating to Ms. Giuffre. RFP 7 sought
Epstein's documents relating to Ms. Maxwell. The subpoena requested Epstein make the
production of documents within the Southern District of Florida
6. On September 2, 2016, Epstein's legal counsel sent a letter to Ms. Giuffre's legal
counsel raising various objections to production of documents, including a Fifth Amendment
privilege. See Mccawley Deel., Exhibit 4 (Goldberger letter). (Because the letter was sent via
conventional mail, counsel did not receive it until September 8, 2016.)

7. On September 9, 2016, Epstein appeared pursuant to the subpoena and was
deposed. See Mccawley Dec., Exhibit 5 (transcript of Epstein's deposition). The deposition
took place in West Palm Beach, Florida.
8. After Epstein was sworn in, he invoked his Fifth Amendment right on every
single substantive question he was asked, except the question asking his name. He was asked
approximately 500 substantive questions by counsel for Ms. Giuffre and approximately 100
substantive questions by counsel for defendant Maxwell. He did not answer a single one.2
9. Counsel for Ms. Giuffre attempted to confer with Epstein's counsel regarding the
basis for the privilege objections, but Epstein's counsel declined to elaborate. Epstein Depo. Tr.
at 10.
10. With regard to the subpoena producing documents, Epstein took the Fifth rather
than answer questions about whether he had substantial financial resources that could minimize
any burden in responding to the document production request. Id. at 164:22-25.
11. With regard to producing document, Epstein and his lawyers asserted a Fifth
Amendment privilege:
Q. Did you bring any documents with you today pursuant to this subpoena?
A. Fifth.
MR. WEINBERG [c ounsel for Epstein]: We would assert the Fifth Amendment
as well as the act of production for the protections against responding to that
question or producing any documents, relying on the Supreme Court decision in
Hubble, the second circuit August 1st decision in Greenfield.
Q. MR. CASSELL: Understood. I'll assume you have a standing objection
based on the grounds that you just described to all my questions with regard to
this subpoena?
2 Maxwell has designated the entire contents of Epstein's deposition as confidential pursuant to
the Protective Order entered in that case, and, therefore, the contents must be filed under seal.

act of production is going to apply to everything that --

3 Defense counsel for Ms. Maxwell raised various "form and foundation" objections to these
questions, which are omitted for purposes of this motion, which seeks to compel actions by
Epstein, not Maxwell.

THE WITNESS: Fifth.
Id. at 226-29.
12. Epstein was also asked specific questions with regard to his failure to produce
certain records, such as telephone records regarding his communications with Maxwell. Epstein
also took the Fifth rather than answer any such question. Id. at 229-30.
13. Epstein was also asked various questions about Maxwell's interactions with
females overseas. In particular, he was asked about actions in England (id. at 140-47), France
(id. at 152-54), Thailand (id. at 154-57), Brunei (id. at 157-59), the Czech Republic (and former
Czechoslovakia) (id. at 159-63), and other foreign countries (id. at 163-64 ). Epstein refused to
answer any of these questions. In latter questioning, Epstein took the Fifth rather than admit that
part of his basis for asserting the Fifth Amendment privilege was fear of foreign prosecutions.
Id. at 343.
14. Ms. Giuffre now files the motion to compel production of the documents pursuant
to her duly-issued subpoena.
LEGAL STANDARDS
Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 45, a party may request any person to appear for a
deposition to answer questions and to produce documents within his possession. Under Fed. R.
Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B), a person who objects to production can lodge an objection. At that point, the
party seeking production can move for an order compelling production of the documents, Fed. R.
Civ. P. 45(d)(2)(B)(i), which is the step that Ms. Giuffre is now taking. The motion for
production of documents must be filed in the Court where production is required- i.e., in this
Comi. Similarly, with regard to production of testimony, a party seeking discovery can move for
7
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 18 of 43
an order requiring disclosure. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(l). The motion must also be made in the
Court where the discovery is to be taken- i.e., in this Court. Fed. R. Civ. P. 37(a)(l).
A party contending that a subpoena should be quashed pursuant to Rule 45(c) (3)(A)(iv)
must demonstrate that compliance with the subpoena would be unduly burdensome." Bridgeport
Music Inc. v. UMG Recordings, Inc., No. 05CIV.6430(VM)(JCF), 2007 WL 4410405, at *l
(S.D.N.Y. Dec. 17, 2007). In addition, a party asserting that he is privileged not to produce a
document has the burden of establishing that privilege. See Maple Wood Partners, L.P. v. Indian
Harbor Ins. Co., 295 F.R.D. 550, 583 (S.D. Fla. 2013) (applying Florida law) ("the burden of
demonstrating that a privilege applies to a particular communication ... is on the proponent of
the privilege"); United States v. Bright, 596 F.3d 683, 691 (9th Cir. 2010) (witness asserting
Fifth Amendment privilege "bears the burden of showing testimony or documents are
privileged").
While Epstein can assert a Fifth Amendment privilege in this civil case, "it is not for the
witness to determine whether the answers are protected; it is a decision left to the sound
discretion of the trial court after considering the circumstances of the case. [T]o assert the
privilege there must be a "substantial and 'real' "threat of incrimination and not one that is
"merely trifling or imaginary." Taubert v. State, Office ofAtty. Gen., 79 So. 3d 77, 81 (Fla. Dist.
Ct. App. 2011) (citing Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 53 (1968); State v. Mitrani, 19
So.3d 1065, 1068 (Fla. 5th DCA 2009) (o ther internal citations omitted)). After Epstein explains
the basis for his invocation, and Ms. Giuffre responds, this Court then makes findings on a
question-by-question basis. See, e.g., Capitol Prod. Corp. v. Hernon, 457 F.2d 541, 544 (8th
Cir. 1972) ("To protect the right of both parties and assure satisfactory review, the comi should
8
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 19 of 43
clearly state the basis on which it sustains or rejects the defendant's objection to a particular
question.").
Because this case is a diversity action state law generally provides the rule of decision for
substantive privilege issues. See Giuffre v. Maxwell, DE 135 at 6, 2016 WL 175918 at* 6
(applying New York privilege law) (citing Allied Irish Banks v. Bank ofA m., NA., 240 F.R.D.
96, 102 (S.D.N.Y. 2007) ("Because this Court's subject matter jurisdiction is based upon
diversity ... state law provides the rule of decision concerning the claim of attorney-client
privilege.")). In this case, Epstein's inability to provide a basis for Fifth Amendment invocations
does not turn on peculiarities of the law of any one jurisdiction, and thus authorities from various
jurisdictions are cited interchangeably.
ARGUMENT
I. EPSTEIN SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO PRODUCE THE REQUESTED
DOCUMENTS.
A. It is Not Unduly Burdensome for Epstein to Produce the Requested
Documents.
If Epstein wishes to establish undue burdensomeness in producing documents, it is his
burden to carry. As recounted above, however, Epstein has refused to answer questions
regarding undue burdensomeness. See Statement of Fact, at~ 10. Presumably this is because
his vast wealth would make it difficult from him to prove that point.
In any event, even were Epstein to attempt to show undue burdensomeness, he could not
establish that any burden is "undue." Epstein is a central figure in this case - the most central
figure, apart from the two parties, the plaintiff and the defendant. And the defendant is feigning
memory loss over many of the most significant events in this case - including many events that
involved Epstein. Because of his central role in the case, it is important for Ms. Giuffre to have
the requested documents from him. No undue burden exists.
9
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 20 of 43
B. Epstein Cannot Assert a Fifth Amendment Privilege in the Documents
Themselves.
As reflected in the transcript quoted above, Epstein asserted both a Fifth Amendment
privilege not to produce the documents as well as a Fifth Amendment act-of-production
privilege. The act of production issues will be addressed in the next section below. But
Epstein's Fifth Amendment objection is frivolous.
The contents of pre-existing documents are not protected by the Fifth Amendment. The
Fifth Amendment only protects a witness against testifying about certain events, not producing
documents already in his position. In his deposition, Epstein's legal counsel referenced two
cases: United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000); and United States v. Greenfield, --- F.3d ---,
2016 WL 4073250 (2d Cir. Aug. 2, 2016). But as both of those cases make clear, a defendant
does not have a Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to produce documents (as opposed to the
privilege that does exist to refuse to give testimony verbally). The Supreme Court in Hubbell
specifically noted "the settled proposition that a person may be required to produce specific
documents even though they contain incriminating assertions of fact or belief because the
creation of those doctiments was not 'compelled' within the meaning of the [Fifth Amendment]
privilege." Hubbell, 530 U.S. at 35-36 (citing Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391 (1976)).
Similarly, the Second Circuit in Greenfield, following the Supreme Court's lead, held that "the
contents of the records [do] not implicate the Fifth Amendment." --- F.3d ---, 2016 WL 4073250
at *5 (reviewing Fisher, 425 U.S. at 409-10). See also Braswell v. United States, 487 U.S. 99,
102 ( 1988) ("There is no question but that the contents of subpoenaed business records are not
privileged."); United States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, 612 n. 10 (1984) ("If the party asserting the
Fifth Amendment privilege has voluntarily compiled the document, no compulsion is present and
the contents of the document are not privileged.").
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 21 of 43
In light of these controlling authorities, Epstein cannot rely on a Fifth Amendment self
incrimination argument to withhold the documents.
C. Epstein Cannot Assert an Act of Production Privilege to Refuse to Produce
the Documents to Ms. Giuffre.
Epstein cannot demonstrate that the act of producing documents in incriminating for two
separate and independent reasons. First, he will not be producing anything publicly or to the
Government, but only confidentially to Ms. Giuffre - a private party. Because any such
production will be confidential and pursuant to a protective order, Epstein faces no substantial
threat of prosecution from making the disclosure. Second, Epstein's act of production (as
opposed to the documents themselves) is not incriminating.
1. Pr9_ducing Documents Confidentially to a Private Party Under a Protective
Order Does Not Create a Substantial Risk of Incrimination.
During his deposition, Epstein cited two cases as supporting his Fifth Amendment
invocations: United States v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27 (2000); and United States v. Greenfield, --
F.3d ---, 2016 WL 4073250 (2d Cir. Aug. 2, 2016). But as even a cursory review of the case
captions in those cases makes clear, both of those cases involved litigation in which the
Government was attempting to force a witness to disclose information to it. In Hubbell, the issue
was whether the Government could issue a subpoena to force a witness to turn over documents to
a grandjury investigating criminal charges. 530 U.S. at 30-31. In Greenfield, the issue was
similarly whether the Government (specifically the Internal Revenue Service or IRS) could force
a taxpayer to turn over records demonstrating possible tax evasion to it.
Here, no such ·disclosure to the Government will occur if Epstein is compelled to provide
answers to Ms. Giuffre's questions. Moreover, the entire deposition has already been designated
as "confidential" by defendant Maxwell, making the proceedings subject to a protective order.
See Addendum A ( copy of protective order). In such circumstances, there is no substantial risk
11
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 22 of 43
of incrimination from the mere production of documents to Ms. Giuffre's counsel. See generally
Marc Youngelson, The Use of2 6(c) Protective Orders: "Pleading the Fifth" Without Suffering
"Adverse" Consequences, 1994 Ann. Surv. Am. L. 245 (1995); see also Palmieri v. State ofN ew
York, 779 F.2d 861 (2d Cir. 1985).
4
Pursuant to the protective order, Ms. Giuffre's counsel (and Ms. Maxwell's counsel ) are
forbidden to disclose the materials for "any purpose except the preparation and trial of this case."
Protective Order, i 4. Under the terms of the protective order, all materials secured in the case
will be destroyed at the end of the case. Protective Order, i 12. And while the Protective Order
does not bar the use of confidential materials at trial, Protective Order i 13, Ms. Giuffre's
counsel represent that they will not use at trial any documents that Epstein produces without first
notifying Epstein and seeking leave of Court to do so. As a result, Epstein can provide
documents to Ms. Giuffre, allowing her to investigate this case without compromising any
interest that Epstein may have in avoiding self-incrimination. And most important, because all
of the relevant proceedings to this motion - including this motion itself- are under seal at this
time, the Government will not even be aware of Epstein's disclosure of materials, much less be
in position to even file a motion to attempt alter the protective order. In such circumstances,
Epstein faces no "real and substantial hazard" of his act of producing documents to Ms. Giuffre' s
counsel incriminating himself. United States v. Kowalik, 809 F. Supp. 1571, 1577 (S.D. Fla.
1992), affd, 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993), and ajj'd, 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993).
2. Epstein's Mere Act of Producing Documents Does Not Incriminate
Himself.
Epstein's act of producing documents to Ms. Giuffre's counsel will not only be unknown
to the Government, but it is, in any event, not incriminating. It bears emphasizing- again - that
4
It may be relevant to note that defendant Maxwell has not sought any documents from Epstein,
and thus the only issue presented here is the extent to which Ms. Giuffre can use the documents.
12
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 23 of 43
the only possible claim Epstein can raise is not that the document he possesses are in some sense
incriminating, but only that the act of producing those documents is incriminating. See United
States v. Doe, 465 U.S. 605, _ (1984) (O'Connor, J., concurring) ("the Fifth Amendment
provides absolutely no protection for the contents of private papers of any kind."); United States
v. Hubbell, 530 U.S. 27, 35-36 (2000) (noting that it is a "settled proposition that a person may
be required to produce specific documents even though they contain incriminating assertions of
fact or belief because the creation of those documents was not 'compelled' within the meaning of
the privilege"); Sallah v. Worldwide Clearing LLC, 855 F. Supp. 2d 1364, 1371 (S.D. Fla. 2012)
("Where documents are voluntarily prepared before they are requested, for example, the
Supreme Court has held that such documents do not contain 'compelled testimonial evidence'
within the meaning of the Fifth Amendment, even if the contents are incriminating."). The so
called "act of production doctrine" extends protection only to "communicative elements" of
production, specifically where compliance with a subpoena could disclose to the Government
incriminating information about "(1) the existence of the documents; (2) the [witness's]
possession or control of the documents; and (3) the authenticity of the documents." United
States v. Greenfield, 2016 WL 4073250 at *5 (citing Fisher v. United States, 425 U.S. 391,411
(1976)).
Once again, Epstein will not be making any act of production to the Government. And,
in any event, for many documents of the subpoenaed documents, no plausible claim of act-of
production testimony and incrimination5 are possible. While Ms. Giuffre will respond to any
effort that Epstein makes to carry his burden of establishing his privilege, a few simple
5 Under the act of production doctrine, Epstein bears the burden of showing both that the
production is incriminating and the testimony is incriminating.
13
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 24 of 43
illustrations will demonstrate that Epstein's claim that he need not produce even a single
document is vastly overbroad.
a. Records Re.fleeting Communications with Maxwell
One simple example is the request for records reflecting communications between
117,
Epstein and defendant Maxwell, including cellular telephone records. See Subpoena, 13.
Cell phone records, which would obviously have been sent to Epstein by his carrier, can be
easily authenticated by people other than Epstein - including representatives of the carrier or
others knowledgeable in cell phone records. See Sallah, 855 F. Supp. 2d at 1374 (requiring
production of contracts because "any contracts could be authenticated by someone other than
[the person invoking the Fifth Amendment]"). As a result, such records are the kind of
regularly-sent business records for which act of production claims are regularly rejected. See
Greenfield, 2016 WL4073250 at *11 (noting that "large commercial financial institutions ...
naturally would have sent regular account statements and other disclosures to account holders . ..
. ") (citing United States v. Norwood, 420 F.3d 888, 895-96 (8th Cir. 2005) (allowing production
of documents "possessed by the owners of financial accounts as a matter of course" associated
with specific identified accounts)); see Matter of Grand Jury Subpoenas Dated Oct. 22, 1991, &
Nov. 1, 1991, 959 F.2d 1158, 1165 (2d Cir. 1992) ("the act of producing copies of the telephone
company statements and bills would not cause Doe to incriminate himself').
b. Bank Records Reflecting Payments
Another similar example is the request for financial records involving payments made to
defendant Maxwell. See Subpoena, 121. Here again, the simple act of producing the bank
records involved in such payments cannot be recorded as either testimonial or incriminating.
This is a case where it can be shown "with reasonable particularity that, at the time that the act of
production was sought to be compelled, . .. the materials were already known of, thereby
14
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 25 of 43
making any testimonial aspect [o f the production] a 'foregone conclusion."' Sallah v.
Worldwide Clearing LLC, 855 F. Supp. 2d 1364, 1372 (S.D. Fla. 2012) (quoting In re Grand
Jury Subpoena Duces Tecum Dated March 25, 2011, 670 F.3d 1335, 1346 (11th Cir.2012) (some
internal citations omitted). Indeed, this Court has recently required the production of bank
records over a Fifth Amendment objections. See Sallah, 855 F.Supp.2d at 1375 ("The Fifth
Amendment does not shield [t he witness's] act of production in response to this request [s eeking
monthly bank account records]."). Moreover, because the documents involve payments to one
specifically identified person- i.e., Maxwell- the request calls for Epstein to produce "an
objectively determinable universe[] of documents and do[es] not require [him] to employ the
contents of his mind to choose what documents might be responsive to the requests. Sallah, 855
F.Supp.2d at 1373 (internal quotations omitted).
c. Photographs Depicted Nude Females
Epstein also lacks any self-incrimination claim for failing to produce photographs of nude
or partially nude females. See Subpoena,~ 5.6 A photograph obviously does not involve
testimony. And the authenticity of photographs can be established in different ways not
involving Epstein. For example, if a photograph fairly and accurately depicts Ms. Giuffre, she
herself could authenticate the photograph.
3. Epstein Must, at a Minimum, Produce a Privilege Log.
These examples of documents that could be produced without risk of incrimination could
be easily multiplied - and Ms. Giuffre, by filing this motion, seeks to compel Epstein to respond
to all 22 of her document requests. But in considering Fifth Amendment issues, a broader point
6 If Epstein possesses particular photographs that are "child pornography," then production of
those particular photographs could itself be incriminating. However, child pornography is
narrowly defined as images of a minor "engaging in sexually explicit conduct." See 18 U.S.C.
2256(8)(A). Ms. Giuffre is not seeking the production of any such contraband materials from
Epstein.
15
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 26 of 43
becomes relevant. Epstein does not appear to have even bothered to first collect responsive
documents before asserting a Fifth Amendment claim. For example, during his deposition,
Epstein took the Fifth rather than answer a question about whether he had produced a privilege
log. Epstein Depo. Tr. at 228.
Under the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure, Epstein is required to produce a privilege log
for the communications he is withholding. Fed. R. Civ. P. 45(e)(2)(A) provides that "[a] person
withholding subpoenaed information under a claim that it is privileged . .. must describe the
nature of the withheld documents, communications, or tangible things in a manner that, without
revealing information itself privileged or protected, will enable the parties to assess the claim."
Epstein should have provided this log at the time of his deposition so that he could be questioned
about it. He certainly should produce a log immediately, if he hopes to sustain his claim.
The "general rule" in this Court is that a "blanket refusal to produce records or to testify
is simply insufficient to support a Fifth Amendment claim." United States v. Kowalik, 809 F.
Supp. 1571, 1577 (S.D. Fla. 1992), aff'd,. 12 F.3d 218 (11th Cir. 1993), and ajf'd,. 12 F.3d 218
(11th Cir. 1993). Instead, a witness who has been subpoenaed to produce documents "must
present himself with his records for questioning, and as to each question and each record elect to
raise or not to raise the defense." Id ( discussing taxpayer's refusal to respond to IRS summons).
In addition, the Court's local rules require the production of a privilege log whenever materials
are withheld on the basis of privilege. See Local 26.l(e)(2)(C) ("This rule requires preparation
of a privilege log with respect to all documents, electronically stored information, things and oral
communications withheld on the basis of a claim of privilege .... except [a ttorney-client
communications or work product materials created after the lawsuit].").
16
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 27 of 43
Epstein was served with a subpoena from the U.S. District Court for the Southern District
of New York. That Court also requires production of a privilege log at the time of any objection
to a subpoena. As that Court has explained:
Both Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(b)(5) and 45(c) and S.D.N.Y. Civ. R. 26.2 require the
submission of a privilege log where a person served with a document request or
subpoena objects to the production of requested documents on the ground of
privilege. Rule 26(b)(5) does not explicitly state exactly when the privilege log
must be provided. Rule 45 is more precise, requiring that a person objecting to a
subpoena must serve either written objections or move to quash within the earlier
of the time fixed for compliance or fourteen days after service and, if withholding
subpoenaed material on the ground of privilege, must provide a privilege log.46 It
thus suggests strongly that the privilege log, absent judicial relief, must
accompany any objections or motion to quash. But Local Rule 26.2 is even more
explicit. Paragraph (c) states:
"Where a claim of privilege is asserted in response to discovery or
disclosure other than a deposition, and information is not provided on the
basis of such assertion, the information set forth in paragraph (a) above
shall be furnished in writing at the time of the response to such discovery
or disclosure, unless otherwise ordered by the court."
This reflects a 1997 modification to the local rules "to specifically require that the
privilege list ... be furnished at the time of the response unless otherwise ordered
by the court. "48
In re Chevron Corp., 749 F. Supp. 2d 170, 180-81 (S.D.N.Y.), affd sub nom. Lago Agrio
Plaintiffs v. Chevron Corp., 409 F. App'x 393 (2d Cir. 2010).
Epstein should, at a minimum, be required to produce a privilege log for each of the 22
questions in the subpoena and explain the basis for his Fifth Amendment invocations. At that
point, Ms. Giuffre will be in a position to further respond and show why his invocations are not
well-founded.
II. EPSTEIN SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS THAT
FACIALLY POSE NO REAL AND SUBSTANTIAL RISK OF SELF
INCRIMINATION.
17
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 28 of 43
Epstein also took the Fifth with regard to many questions for which there was no realistic
risk of self-incrimination. As the Eleventh Circuit has explained, "[t]he central standard for the
... application [of the fifth amendment privilege against self-incrimination is] whether the
claimant is confronted by substantial and 'real', and not merely trifling or imaginary, hazards of
incrimination." United States v. Argomani~, 925 F.2d 1349, 1353 (11th Cir. 1991) (citing
Marchetti v. United States, 390 U.S. 39, 53 (1968). Thus, the privilege applies only in "instances
where the witness has reasonable cause to apprehend danger" of criminal liability. Argomaniz,
925 F.2d at 1353 (citing Hoffman v. United States, 341 U.S. 479,486 (1951)).
Not only does Epstein bear the burden of establishing the validity of his privilege claim,
but a "court must make a particularized inquiry, deciding, in com1ection with each specific area
that the questioning party wishes to explore, whether or not the privilege is well-founded."
Argomaniz, 925 F.2d 1349, 1355 (11th Cir. 1991). Here, there are a number of questions that
does not appear to pose any "substantial and real" risk of incrimination. These questions include
the following:
1. Q. Is there anything, including any physical conditions or ailments, that would
prevent you from giving truthful testimony today? (Id. at 15).
2. Q. What state do you consider yourself to be a citizen of? (Id. at 15-16).
3. Q. You know the Defendant in this case, Ghislaine Maxwell, true? (Id. at 16).

the Fifth rather than answer this question.

It is up to Epstein to show that each of these questions that he refused to answer posed a
substantial risk of self-incrimination. Moreover, if Epstein can provide even some information
in answer to the question without incriminating himself, he must provide that partial answer.
See, e.g., Nat'! Day Laborer Org. Network v. U.S. Immigration & Customs Enft Agency, 811 F.
Supp. 2d 713, 740 (S.D.N.Y. 2011), amended on reconsideration (Aug. 8, 2011) (discussing
21
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 32 of 43
documents "redacted to different degrees" to provide information without violating privilege);
Jones v. B. C. Christopher & Co., 466 F. Supp. 213, 223 (D. Kan. 1979) (noting that witness
"may make partial answers and stop when he believes further comment would incriminate him").
A "witness is not exonerated from answering merely because he declares that in so doing he
would incriminate himself; his say-so does not of itself establish the hazard of incrimination."
Martin-Trigona v. Gouletas, 634 F.2d 354, 360 (7th Cir. 1980). Because Epstein cannot
establish the hazard of incrimination with respect to each of the questions above, the Court
should compel him to answer each of these questions (and permit counsel to ask reasonable
follow-up questions in the same vein).
III. EPSTEIN SHOULD BE COMPELLED TO ANSWER QUESTIONS ABOUT
MAXWELL'S INVOLVEMENT WITH FEMALES IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES.
Epstein should also be compelled to answer questions about Maxwell's involvement with
females in foreign countries. The Supreme Court has made very clear that a witness may not
invoke a Fifth Amendment privilege to refuse to answer questions that pose a risk of prosecution
in foreign countries. United States v. Balsys, 524 U.S. 666 (1998). The Court reasoned that the
Fifth Amendment creates rights only against the federal government (and, via incorporation
through the Fourteenth Amendment, against state governments). Id. at 672-74. As a result, any
argument that the Fifth Amendment has extra-territorial application has been foreclosed.
Valenzuela v. United States, 286 F.3d 1223, 1229 (11th Cir. 2002).
In light of this controlling legal authority, Ms. Giuffre asked Epstein a series of very
narrow and specific questions about purely foreign activities. The questions began with the
limitation that Epstein was "to understand that the next series of questions we'll be dealing just
with your actions in England, not with any of your actions in the United States." Epstein Depo.
Tr. at 140. Epstein was then asked a series of questions - including a number of questions
22
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 33 of 43
involving "English females." This limitation is important because Epstein may seek to invoke a
Fifth Amendment privilege with regard to his trafficking of American girls into England. See,
e.g., 18 U.S.C. § 2421(a). But no such trafficking concerns exist with regard to females already
located in England.
For these reasons, Ms. Giuffre is entitled to force Epstein to disclose even his activities
with foreign females in foreign countries. But in this motion, Ms. Giuffre does not go so far.
Instead, she moves the Court to compel answers to a much narrower set of questions -
specifically, Maxwell's interactions with females overseas in specific countries. The specific
questions Ms. Giuffre moves to compel Epstein to answer are:
England
1. Q. While in England, in Miss Maxwell's private residence, you observed Maxwell
in the presence of English females under the age of 18, true? (Id.)
2. Q. While in England, Ms. Maxwell brought you English females to satisfy your
sexual purposes, true? (Id.)
3. Q. Please describe how many times you have seen Maxwell in private locations
with girls under the age of 18 in England? (Id. at 142)
4. Q. Based on your understanding of English criminal law, you have observed
Maxwell commit English criminal offenses of a sexual nature in England, true?
(Id.)
5. Q. Have you ever observed Maxwell commit a crime in England? (Id. at 143.)
6. Q. Please describe for me all the crimes you have seen Maxwell commit in
England. (Id. at 144.)
7. Q. Please describe Maxwell's interactions in England with females under the age
of 18. (Id. at 144.)
France

Thailand
9. Q. You saw Maxwell in the presence of Thai females under the age of 18 in

Brunei
10. Q. In 2002, you flew to Brunei with Maxwell on your private jet, true? (Id. at

11. Q. Are you aware of .. . interaction by Maxwell with women in Brunei? (Id. at

18 in Brunei? (Id.)
12. Q. Please describe all the interactions you saw between Maxwell and girls from
Brunei in Brunei. (Id.)

13. Q. Was Maxwell ever with you when you were in the presence of girls under the
age of 18 in the Czech Republic? (Id. at 161.)
14. Q. Has Maxwell ever interacted with minor girls from the former country known
as Czechoslovakia? (Id. at 163.)
Other Countries
15. Q. Please name all of the countries, not including the United States, where you
have seen Maxwell in the presence of females who lived in those countries under
the age of 18. (Id. at 162.)
16. Q. Please describe for me Maxwell's sexual interactions with females under the
age of 18 in foreign countries with citizens of those countries. (Id. at 162.)
17. Q. Has Maxwell ever interacted with females under the age of 18 in foreign
countries? (Id. at 162-63.)
18. Q. Based on your understanding of the criminal laws of other countries, has
Maxwell ever committed a crime of a sexual nature in another country? (Id. at
164.)
24
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1330-15 Filed 01/05/24 Page 35 of 43
19. Q. Please describe all the crimes of a sexual nature that you understand Maxwell
has committed foreign countries. (Id. at 164.)
20. Q. Epstein cannot claim a realistic risk of incriminating himself by discussing
these specific events regarding Maxwell.
CONCLUSION
For the reasons set forth above, plaintiff, Virginia Giuffre, respectfully requests that the
Court grant her Motion to Compel and direct Jeffrey Epstein to: (1) produce the documents that
he has been subpoenaed to produce (or, at the very least, produce a privilege log for each of the
categories for which documents are sought); (2) answer the specific, identified questions
identified in Section II above (and reasonable follow up questions) that pose no substantial and
real risk of incrimination; and (3) answer specific questions about Maxwell's interactions with
females in other countries (and reasonable follow up questions), as identified in Section III
above.
