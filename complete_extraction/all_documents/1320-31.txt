Subject: Depositions next week
Date: Thursday, June 02, 2016 9:23:30 AM
We got an email yesterday from Mr. Brunel's attorney saying he needs to reschedule. I believe he is trying to get us
new dates today or tomorrow.
We got a similar email from Mr. Fontanella's lawyer yesterday saying that he is also not available next week. His
email said he is available the week of the 27th. I told him I would call him to coordinate a new date once I had
-
spoken with you.
I have not heard from anyone representing JaneDoe2 yet. I was hoping you could tell me whether she is
represented and whether next week works for her or will also need resetting.
As of right now, the only confirmed depo for next week is that of Mr. Rizzo.
Laura, can you talk later this afternoon to see what we can do about a deposition schedule that makes sense for
everyone going forward? I figure Jeff will be flying.
If we don't connect today then I will try to make time to talk with him after the deposition tomorrow. I understand
that the hearing did not go forward this morning which is unfortunate as it gives us a little guidance where the court
stands on the deposition issues. Maybe you and I can talk and try to figure out some plan that works in the
meantime.
