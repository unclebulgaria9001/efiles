1 Q. Is your computer in your office --
2 A. Yes.
3 Q. Let me finish. Is the computer in your
4 office linked up with the three computers that were
5 removed from the house? Meaning, can you look at
6 the system and see what is on those three computers?
7 A. No, no.
8 Q. Is it your understanding that those three
9 computers are linked with one another or do you
10 know?
11 A. I don't know, but I, I doubt it. They are
12 separate I guess.
13 Q. Okay. Were you aware that Mr. Epstein
14 used a Citrix program to link various computers?
15 Did you know that?
16 A. Yeah. I use Citrix too in my computer for
17 exchanging e-mails and get through Internet.
18 Q. Okay. So, is it your understanding that
19 the only connection then through Citrix with these
20 computers, these various computers that were in
21 Mr. Epstein's home, was for e-mail purposes?
22 A. Yes.
23 Q. Okay. To your knowledge, you're not
24 familiar with those computers sharing other files or
25 information?

1 A. No.
2 Q. That's not something that you were, you
3 were privy to? You weren't, you weren't in the loop
4 of the sharing of information in the house in terms
5 of the computers being connected through any server?
6 A. I don't really know what, how, how to answer
7 your question because Citrix is for the whole
8 organization to exchange e-mail between employees.
9 Q. All right. You used the term?
10 A. So, even my computer is connected to Citrix.
11 I can receive mail and I can e-mail information to
12 employee within organization. But I don't know if you
13 can see to each computer what is going on on another
14 computer.
15 Q. You don't know about --
16 A. Is that your question?
17 Q. You don't know about shared files?
18 A. No.
19 Q. You only know that the one computer can
20 e-mail the other?
21 A. Right.
22 Q. But that can happen with any two computers
23 in the world pretty much. You can send e-mails to
24 each other, right.
25 A. Yes.
