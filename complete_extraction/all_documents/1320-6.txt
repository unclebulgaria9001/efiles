Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 1 of 10
United States District Court
Southern District of New York
Virginia L. Giuffre,
Plaintiff, Case No.: 15-cv-07433-RWS
v.
Ghislaine Maxwell,
Defendant.
________________________________/
PLAINTIFF’S UNREDACTED REPLY IN SUPPORT OF MOTION TO COMPEL
DEFENDANT TO ANSWER DEPOSITION QUESTIONS
Plaintiff Virginia Giuffre, by and through her undersigned counsel, hereby files th-is
Reply in Support of her Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition Questions. Instead
of allowing Ms. Giuffre to take a full and complete deposition,Defendant flatly refused to
answer questions critical to the key issues in this case. Contrary to Defendant’s assertions, Ms.
Giuffre is not engaged in a “fishing expedition” but rather seeks to ask highly-focused questions
specifically relevant to this case. In particular, Ms. Giuffre seeks to ask the Defendant questions
regarding her participation in or knowledge of sexual activities connected with Jeffrey Epstein’s
sexual abuse of females. Such questions are entirely appropriate in the discovery phase of this
case, particularly where any answers will be maintained as confidential under the Protective
Order entered in this case.
As the Court is aware from previous pleadings, at the heart of this case lies the issue of
Defendant’s knowledge that Ms. Giuffre was sexually abused by Jeffrey Epstein. Indeed, as the
Defendant boldly acknowledges in her response (at p. 2), she intends to argue at trialthat (among
other things) she “never arranged for or asked [Ms. Giuffre] to have sex with anyone.” At trial,
1
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 2 of 10
Ms. Giuffre intends to strongly disproveDefendant’s false assertions and to demonstratethat
Defendant recruited Ms. Giuffre to be involved in massages of a sexual nature with Epstein.
To develop evidence to support her position, Ms. Giuffre recently deposed Defendant
about the central subjects in her case. Defendant flatly refused to answer a number of questions,
and for the majority of the others, gave varying versions of “I don’t recall.” For example, when
faced with the police report which contains statements from approximatelythirty (30) different
victims during a time frame which the Defendant acknowledges she was actively working for
Epstein at his various homes, Defendant challenged the veracity of the victims’reports:
“Q. Are you saying these 30 girls are lying when they gave these reports to police
officers?
A. I’m not testifying to their lies. I’m testifying to Virginia’s lies.”
SeeDeclaration of Sigrid McCawley (“McCawley Decl.”) at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016
Deposition of Defendant at p. 89-90; 83-84. WhileDefendant was working with Epstein during
the time period when these underage girls were visiting Jeffrey’s home, Defendant claimedto be
at the house maybe once in 2005. Id.at p. 84. Yet, according to flight manifests, in that same
general time period, Defendant was listed as a passengerat least eleven times either landing in or
departing from West Palm Beach, Florida on Jeffrey Epstein’sprivateplane. SeeMcCawley
Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Depo Tr. at p. 84; seealso McCawley Decl.at Composite
Exhibit 2, Flight Logs from Jeffrey Epstein’s private planes.
Moreover, again according to flight logs, Defendant was on Epstein’s planes over 300
times –including 23 times with Ms. Giuffre when Ms. Giuffre was underage. Yet, quite
remarkably, Defendant claimed she “couldn’t recall”even oneof those flights. SeeMcCawley
Decl.at Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 120-122.
2
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 3 of 10
Defendant even testified that she did not recall having Ms. Giuffre at her London
townhome with Prince Andrew. Defendant stuck to this incredible storydespite flight logs
establishing her traveling to London with Ms. Giuffre and despite a photographthe three –Ms.
Giuffre, Prince Andrew and Defendant – all standing together in Defendant’s home. See
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 108-111.
Defendant’s deposition consisted almost entirely of “I don’t recalls” or “I refuse to answer that
question”1 and also included a physical outburst that knocked the court reporter’s computer off
the conference room table. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Deposition of
Defendant at 207-208.
Among the many questions that Defendant refused to answer at her deposition werea
number of questions designed to show that Defendant was well aware that, for Epstein, a
“massage” was actually a code word sexual activity –i.e., not a therapeutic massage but rather
activity that involved sexual gratification for Epstein. Defendant refused to answer all such
questions, asserting that they involved “private adult sexual relationships” which did not “relate
in any way” to Ms. Giuffre’s claims. Id. at p. 4. But Defendant’s involvement in such
“relationships” with Epstein would show that she knew full well the fate that was in store for Ms.
Giuffre when she accepted Defendant’s invitation to come and provide “massages” to Epstein.
Defendant admitted that she worked for Epstein from 1992to 2009. SeeMcCawley Decl. at
1For example, when asked:
“Q. Have you ever said to anybody that you recruit girls to take the pressure off you, so you
won’t have to have sex with Jeffrey, have you said that?
A. You don’t ask me questions like that. First of all, you are trying to trap me, I will not be
trapped. You are asking me if I recruit. I told you no. Girls meaning underage, I already said I don’t do
that with underage people and as to ask me about a specific conversation I had with language, we talking
about almost 17 years ago when this took place. I cannot testify to an actual conversation or language
that I used with anybody at any time.”
SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April 22, 2016 Depo Tr. at p. 94-95.
3
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 4 of 10
Exhibit 1,April 22, 2016 Deposition of Defendant at p. 10-11, 410. As the Court knows, the
Palm Beach Police Report demonstrates multiple incidents of “massages” being given by
untrained minor children that involved sexual acts. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3,Palm
Beach Police Report. Defendant is also identified in that Palm Beach Police Report. See
McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 3, Palm Beach Police Report at p. 75-76. And the details of
Epstein’s sexual activities with Defendant (for example) are highly relevant to this case, because
they will help corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s testimony that, while she was underage, she also
engaged in sexual activity of an identical nature with Epstein.
Toallow Defendant to avoid answering these questions would preclude Ms. Giuffre from
getting critical evidence in this case. Consider, for example, Defendant recruitingan eighteen
year-old girl to be an “assistant,” bringingthat girl to Epstein’s home,tellingher she could make
more money if she would give Epstein a massage, and then instructingher to give a massage that
involved sexual acts. Under Defendant’s theory of discovery, Ms. Giuffre would be precluded
from deposing her on that topic because the actions would culminate in “consensual adult sex.”
Yet, that scenario would fully validatethe pattern of events that occurred with Ms. Giuffre when
she was under the age of eighteen. It would obviously show a “modus operandi”by Jeffrey
Epstein and Defendant, which is clearly admissible under Fed. R. Evid. 404(b).
Moreover, such inquiries are crucial to impeaching the Defendant at trial. During her
deposition, Defendant attempted to characterize her work for Epstein as nothing more than a
normal job handling hiring for the various mansions. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 1, April
22, 2016 Deposition Tr. of Defendant at p. 9-12. Ms. Giuffre should be able to contest that
assertion by having Defendant fully answer questions about whether that alleged“job” involved
4
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 5 of 10
sexual activities, including orchestrating the hiring of females and converting massages into
sexual encounters.
Defendant attempts to paint the picture that Ms. Giuffre somehow is interested in all
sexual relationships that the Defendant may have been involved with. That is not true. Ms.
Giuffre has no intention of asking unbridled questions. To be clear, Ms. Giuffre intends to ask
Defendant only questions that involve the followingvery narrow and crucial subject areas: (1)
Defendant’s sexual relationship with Epstein from 1992 to 2009 –the time period in which she
worked for Jeffrey Epstein and which Epstein (with the assistance of Defendant) was engaging in
sexual acts withfemales under the cover of “massage”; (2) Defendant’s sexual interactionswith
any person in Epstein’s presenceduring that time period; (3) Defendant’s sexual activities at
Epstein’s residences, including his private island “Little St. Jeff’s,” or his aircraftduring that
time period; (4) Defendant’s sexual activities with identified participants in Epstein’s sexual
abuseduring that time period; and (5) Defendant’s sexual interactions that occurred during or
through what began as a “massage”; and (6) Defendant’s interactions with females to introduce
to Jeffrey Epstein for the purpose of performing work, including sexual massages.
Defendant claimsthat such questions are a mere “fishing expedition” without
acknowledging the fact that these questions go to critical issues in this case. Other witnesses
have testified regarding Defendant’s involvement in recruiting females for sex under the cover of
a “massage.” During the investigation of Jeffrey Epstein, certain household staff was deposed.
Alfredo Rodriguez, who was Jeffrey Epstein’s household manager, testified that the Defendant
frequently stayed in Jeffrey Epstein’s home and assisted with bringing in young girls to act as
“masseuses” for Jeffrey Epstein.
Q. “Okay. Going back to where we started here was, does Ghislaine Maxwell have
knowledge of the girls that would come over to Jeffrey Epstein’s house that are in
5
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 6 of 10
roughly the same age group as C. and T. (minor children) and to have a good time as
you put it?
A. Yes.
Q. And what was her involvement and/or knowledge about that?
A. She knew what was going on.”
See McCawley Decl.at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 176-177. See
also McCawleyDecl.at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Depo Tr. at 96-101 (noting
that high school age girls come to the home where Jeffrey Epstein and Ms. Maxwell reside).
Juan Alessi, another household employee, also testified that young girls were regularly present at
Jeffrey Epstein’s home where Ghislaine Maxwell resides. See McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 5,
Juan Alessi November 21, 2005 Sworn Statement at p. 15-16,21. Specifically, Juan Alessi
informed the Palm Beach Police Detective as follows: “Alessi stated that towards the end of his
employment, the masseuses were younger and younger. When asked how young, Mr. Alessi
stated they appeared to be sixteen or seventeen years of age at most.” (emphasis added.) See
McCawleyDecl.at Exhibit 3, Palm Beach Police Report at p. 57.
During Juan Alessi’s November 21, 2005Sworn Statement taken by the Palm Beach
Police Department, Mr. Alessi revealed that girls would come over to give “massages” and he
observed Ms. Maxwell going upstairs in the direction of the bedroom quarters. SeeMcCawley
Decl. at Exhibit 5, Juan Alessi November 21, 2005 Sworn Statement at 10. He also testified that
after the massages, he would clean up sex toys that were kept in “Ms. Maxwell’s closet.” Id. at
11-13. Seealso McCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Juan Alessi September 8, 2009 Depo Tr. at p. 76-
77. He added that he and his wife were concerned with what was going on at the house (Id. at
14) and that he observed girls at the house, including one named “Virginia.” Id.at 21.
Mr. Rodriguez also testified that Defendant also had naked pictures of girls performing
sexual acts on her computer. SeeMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 7, Alfredo Rodriguez August 7,
2009 Dep. Tr. at 311-312; See alsoMcCawley Decl. at Exhibit 6, Juan Alessi September 8, 2009

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 7 of 10
Depo Tr. at p. 40-41(“I know she [Maxwell] went out and took pictures in the pool because later
on I would see them at the desk or at the house. And nude-99.9 percent of the timethey were
topless. They were European girls.”).
Q. “Did they appear to be doing any sexual?
A. Yes, ma’am.
Q. And in these instances were there girls doing sexual things with other girls?
A. Yes, ma’am.
Q. And I’m still talking about the pictures on Ms. Maxwell’s computer.
A. Yes, ma’am.”
Upon leaving his employment, Rodriguez testified that Defendant threatened him that he should
not tell anyone about what happened at the house:
A. “I have to say something. Mrs. Maxwell called me and told me not to ever discuss or
contact her again in a threaten(ing) way.
Q. When was this?
A. Right after I left because I call one of the friends for a job and she told me this, but,
you know, I feel intimidated and so I want to keep her out…
Q. She made a telephone call to you and what precisely did she say?
A. She said I forbid you that you’re going to be –that I will be sorry if I contact any of
her friends again…She said something like don’t open your mouth or something like
that. I’m a civil humble, I came as an immigrant to service people, and right now you
feel a little –I’m 55 and I’m afraid. First of all, I don’t have a job, but I’m glad this is
on tape because I don’t want nothing to happen to me. This is the way they treat you,
better do this and you shut up and don’t talk to nobody and—
Q. When you say this is the way they treat, who specifically are you talking about when
you say that word they?
A. Maxwell. ”
See McCawleyDecl. at Exhibit 4, Alfredo Rodriguez July 29, 2009 Dep. Tr. at 169 –172.
In sum, at the core of this case are statements made by Ms. Giuffre that she was recruited,
by Defendant, to be paid as a masseuse, yet was enticed or coerced into engaging in sexual acts
with Epstein and Defendant for money. She has further explained that the recruitment of females
through the offer of some legitimate position was the typical way in which Defendant and
Epstein lured unsuspecting females to the house before converting the relationship into a sexual
7
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 8 of 10
one. Ms. Giuffre has described the frequency of these “massages”, the sexual tendencies of the
-participants, the manner in which the massages became sexual in nature, and Defendant’s role at
each stage.
In response, Defendant has called Ms. Giuffre’s entire account “untrue” and “obvious
lies.” Defendant has instead tried to portrayher role as nothing more than an Epstein employee
performing typical household management duties. Any personal knowledge Defendant hasof
Epstein’s sexual tendencies, habits, and use of massage for sex is entirely relevant to either
corroborate Ms. Giuffre’s account. Likewise, Defendant’s participation in any sexual acts with
Epstein, in his presence, on his properties, using his mode of converting massages into sex, or
with females will directly corroborateMs. Giuffre’s account. On the other hand, without access
to the answers to these inquiries,Ms. Giuffre will be unable to expose the bias of Defendant,
unable to thoroughly cross-examine Defendant’s position that she was just a lowly employee,
and most importantly unable to demonstrate through the Defendant’s own admissions that Ms.
Giuffre’s statements about Epstein and Defendant were absolutely true –and not “obvious lies.”
Finally, Defendant fails to recognize that, forthe discovery purposes at issue here,
relevance “is an extremely broad concept.” Am. Fed'n of Musicians of the United States &
Canada v. Sony Music Entm't, Inc.,No. 15CV05249GBDBCM, 2016 WL 2609307, at *3
(S.D.N.Y. Apr. 29, 2016). And once relevance is shown, “the party resisting discovery bears the
burden ofdemonstrating that, despite the broad and liberal construction afforded the federal
discovery rules, the requests are irrelevant, or are overly broad, burdensome, or oppressive.” Id.
Here, the requests are not “overly broad” as Ms. Giuffre’s specific explanations of the targets of
her questions makeclear. Moreover, answering the questions is not “oppressive,” particularly
given the fact that Defendant has placed all substantive aspects of the Deposition under seal. Of
8
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1320-6 Filed 01/03/24 Page 9 of 10
course, once Defendant answers the question –and her answers are placed under seal –the
parties can file any further motions that may be required to determine whether the answers may
be introduced at trial.
CONCLUSION
Defendant should be ordered to answer questions regarding sexual activity connected
with Epstein’s sexual abuse and sexualtrafficking organization as specificallyidentified above
