tech Pavlik while she photographed the exterior of the house. Once
this was complete I was assigned to search certain areas of the house
with Det. Dawson as part of the search warrant.
We began in the garage, searching three Mercedes Benz vehicles, a
Harley Davidson motorcycle and adjacent closets in the garage .
Nothing of evidentiary value was located.
We then searched two closets off the kitchen area on the east
side. These can best be described as pantry or storage closets.
Nothing of evidentiary value was obtained.
A small office with adjoining bath was then searched. In the bath
area I located a phone message book with recent messages . This item
was seized as evidence. Please note this bath and shower area are not
used as designed but are storage areas containing a variety of items
to include a gun safe in the shower and assorted household items.
a
We then searched bath area and closet at the base of the main
stairs in the foyer. Inside the closet two massage tables were
located as well as partial nude female photographs. These items were
later seized as evidence. Nothing of evidentiary value was noted in
the bathroom.
We then searched two bedrooms upstairs on the east side of the
residence. Located in the bath room of the south bedroom was penis
shaped soap. Located in the bedroom of the northern bedroom was penis
and vagina shaped soap as well as an adult sex toy. These items were
seized as evidence.
We then searched the pool cabana located in the south west corner
of the property. Several photographs of nude females were seized as
evidence.
I was then assigned to stand by with a person I believe was
Douglas Schoettle. Mr. Schoettle was in the residence at the
beginning of the search warrant. He was present during the warrant
service and subsequent search. I stood by with him until the search
was completed and I departed the residence. I had no conversation
with him regarding the reason for our presence.
Regarding seized evidence, all items were photographed in place
and then collected by CSEU personnel .
This concludes my involvement in this case.

On Thursday, October 20, 2005 at approximately 0936 hours, I assisted
in the execution of a search warrant located at 358 El Brillo Way,
Palm Beach, Florida, residence of Jeffrey Epstein. I was instructed
by Case Agent Det . Joseph Recarey, to secure all computer and media
related material from the residence.
Upon my arrival I was directed by Det . Recarey to a room designated as
the Kitchen Staff Office. I observed a, Silver in color, CPU with the
left side cover removed, exposing the CPUs hardware sitting on floor
next to a glass type desk. The CPU had no discernable identifiers or
features indicating a make or model. This CPU was powered off with
the power cord not plugged in . The keyboard and mouse were atop the
CPU. It should be noted that the CPU was not connected to a monitor,
printer, or other media device . On the back Panel of the CPU, I
observed an A/V card with RCA jacks attached. This type of hardware
would allow audio and video to be downloaded onto the CPUs hard disk.
The ends of the RCA jacks were unattached at the time of the search
and no external camera was located within this room.
The CPU was located on the right side of a desk that held a flat panel
LCD screen. The desk also held another keyboard and mouse, indicative
of a second computer; however, no other computer was found. It
appeared as though a second computer had been recently removed as the
cables ends from the monitor, keyboard and mouse were in the same
area. A further search of the room revealed no media storage devices,
i .e. CDs, Floppy Disks, Zip Disks, etc. This type of media is
commonly stored in an area where computers are placed, yet no media
was found.
After completing a search of this room, I secured the CPU and turned
all items over to the Evidence Custodian for future forensic analysis
via a property receipt.
I was then directed by Det. Recarey to a room designated as the Garden
Room, where I observed a wooden desk facing west. The desk held a
flat screen LCD monitor, keyboard, mouse, media card reader and
printer; however, no CPU was located. All of the cables were removed
from an area where a computer had once been. A search of the desk
area revealed no signs of any media devices.
Det. Recarey directed me to a third location designated as the Cabana
room, which is detached from the residence and located just south of
the pool. In the South East corner of the room, I observed an office
type setting, with an L-shaped desk holding a flat screen LCD monitor,
keyboard, mouse and printer; however, no CPU was located, All of the
cables were removed from an area where a computer had once been. A
search of the desk area revealed no signs of any media devices.

Det. Recarey directed me to a second detached structure located on the
South East corner of the property. This area of this structure was
assigned with single letters to identify a particular part of the
room. In the office area, designated as Room B, I observed a powered
on Dell Dimension 2350, attached to an LCD flat panel monitor. The
screen displayed an open Microsoft Internet Explorer browser with URL
address of http://home.bellsouth.net/. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen .. The power
cord was removed from the back of the Dell CPU and I disconnected the
cable modem to prevent remote access. At that time, the Dell CPU,
marked with Seri~l Number 6WTVN21, was secured and turned over the
evidence custodian for future forensic analysis via property receipt ..
I also located several media related items within Room B, which were
recorded onto a property receipt and turned over the Evidence
Custodians.
I then responded to a Bedroom designated as Room F, where I observed a
white in color CPU marked Premio. The Premio CPU was in a computer
desk which held a white CRT monitor, both of which were powered on.
The CRT monitor displayed a message from Norton Antivirus software,
warning of an expired subscription. I observed no other active
windows in the Start panel window and photographed screen. I removed
the power cable from the back of the Prernio CPU and shutdown all other
media. The Premio CPU, marked with Serial Number 2000091078, was
secured and turned over the evidence custodian for future forensic
analysis via property receipt. I also located several media related
items within Room F, which were recorded onto a property receipt and
turned over the Evidence Custodians.
This concluded my participation in the search of the residence .

On December 20, 2005, I contacted ASA Daliah Weiss in an attempt to
subpoena the Epstein former houseman, Alfredo Rodriguez. Rodriguez,
who resides in Miami, had eluded the process servers previously and
was not served the investigative subpoena. A telephone message was
left as she is not available during the week of 12/19/2005. I made
contact with State Attorney Inv Theresa Wyatt and requested the same
via telephone message.
I then researched the victim's-cellular telephone subpoena data
which had been received from a previous subpoena request. I analyzed
the records which depict several calls frorn Haley Robson. The
telephone calls start on February 6, 2005 at 12:49 pm.; the same day
which the victim and the victim's father stated the incident occurred
at Epstein s house. The first incoming call was from Robson's

cellular phone 561-308-0282 occurred at 1:02 pm. The call durations
were one minute or less. The time frame was within thirteen minutes
apart. It should be noted that Robson s residence was in close
proximity to the victim's. The next call occurred at 5:50 pm when the
victim telephoned Robson s residence. Several calls were made after
the above mentioned calls both incoming and outgoing to Robson.
Further analysis showed no telephone calls to either Robson's cellular
telephone or Robson's residence were registered prior to February 6,
2005.
Additionally, I also conducted an analysis on the telephone calls from
305-710-5165. The subscriber information confirmed that the number is
registered to Paul A Lavery from Hialeah, Florida. The address was
crossed referenced to the Office of Kiraly and Riley Private
Investigators. I researched the web page www.rileykiraly.com which
also showed various cases in which they assisted. I also located
another web site under www.coralspringssparklandrotary.org in which
Mr. Riley attended a Miami Rotary meeting and confirmed Atty. Roy
Black is among his clientele.

During a sworn taped statement, Mr. Rodriguez stated he was employed
by Jeffrey Epstein for approximately six months. He was referred by
associates and his employment lasted the months of November 2004
through May 2005. His responsibilities as house manager included
being the butler, chauffer, chef, houseman, run errands for Mr.
Epstein and provide for Epstein1s guests. Rodriguez advised he had
very limited contact with Mr. Epstein. If Rodriguez needed to relay a
message to Mr. Epstein, he would have to notify Epstein's secretary
"Leslie" in New York City, who would then notify Epstein's personal
assistant, Sarah, who would relay the message to Epstein. Rodriguez
stated Epstein did not want to see or hear the staff when he was in
residence.
I asked Rodriguez if Epstein received many guests during his stay in
Palm Beach. Rodriguez advised he had many guests. I asked
specifically about masseuses coming to the house. Rodriguez stated he
would have two massages a day. Epstein would have one massage in the
morning and one massage in the afternoon everyday he was in residence.
Rodriguez stated he would be informed to expect someone and make them
comfortable until either Sarah or Epstein would meet with them.
Rodriguez stated once the masseuses would arrive, he would allow them
entry into the kitchen area and offer them something to drink or eat.
They would then be encountered by either Sarah or Epstein. They
would be taken upstairs to provide the massage. I asked Rodriguez if
any of the masseuses appeared young in age, He advised he didn't ask
their ages but felt they were very young. Rodriguez stated they ate
like his own daughter who is in high school. Rodriguez stated they
would eat tons of cereal and drink milk all the time. Rodriguez
stated the girls that would come appeared to be too young to be
masseuses. He stated one time un4er E&stein1s direction, he delivered
J
a dozen roses to I for one of the girls
that came to provide a massage. He knew the girls were still in high
school and were of high school age. I asked Rodriguez about the
massages. He felt there was a lot more going on than just massages.
He would clean Mr. Epstein1s bed.room after the alleged massages and
would discover massager/vibrators and sex toys scattered on the floor .
He also said he would wipe down the vibrators and sex toys and put
them away in an arrnoire. He described the armoire as a small wood
armoire which was on the wall close to Epstein's bed.
Epstein ordered Rodriguez to go to the Dollar rent a car and rent a
car for the same girl he brought the roses to, so that she could drive
her self to Epstein's house without incident. Rodriguez said the girl
always needed rides to and from the house. Rodriguez referred himself
as a "human ATM machine" and was ordered by Epstein to maintain a
minimum balance of $2,000 dollars on him at all times. When a girl
would come by the house and Mr. Epstein was either not in residence or
was not at home at the time, Rodriguez was to provide the girl
(masseuse) several hundred dollars for their time and to notify
Epstein the amount they were given. Epstein also ordered Rodriguez to

seemed to know at -•••••••■•■•••••who Mr. Epstein was .
When asked to identify these girls, Rodriguez stated he could not at
the moment but knew he wrote their names down on a journal he kept
during his employ with Mr. Epstein. He kept a journal in the event he
needed to explain either to Mr. Epstein or his assistants what was
done at the house or who visited the house as he stated he was
in-charge of Mr. Epstein's personal security while in Palm Beach. I
informed him I would need to view this journal to which he stated he
would research the book and contact me to provide the book. The
interview was concluded and left the area. I returned back to the
police station where the micro cassette was placed into evidence. At
approximately 7:20 pm, I was notified Rodriguez located the journal
and would call me on January 5, 2005 to provide the journal .

between two consenting adults. I explained to her that she was not in
any trouble however as part of this investigation, I needed to ask
certain questions. Sjoberg stated that there were times that Epstein
would ask her to perform during the massage. He would instruct her to
rub his nipples as he masturbated himself . Sjoberg stated she felt
"grossed" about the behavior but as she was getting paid, she just
continued. Sjoberg also advised she would on occasion perform the
massages naked. Epstein would on occasion, utilize the
vibrator/massager on her vagina area when she performed the massages.
Sjoberg explained that Epstein never exposed himself to her as he
maintained himself covered under the towel he would be wearing. When
Epstein would masturbate he would be covered.
I asked if Sjoberg ever received any gifts, or any gratuities from
Epstein. Sjoberg advised aside from being paid well, she advised
Epstein took care of her tuition from Palm Beach Atlantic College ,
She received a rental car for a week when her scooter broke down.
Additionally she received other gifts from Epstein. Epstein also

her breasts during the massages. Harrison replied. ''Yes. 11 I asked her
if Epstein ever touched or massaged her vagina. Harrison stated he
had on several occasions. I asked her if he ever penetrated her with
either his penis or any other objects. Harrison stated that during a
massage he inserted his fingers in her vagina as she massaged him.
She stated this occurred one time only. Harrison stated the massage
would be over when Epstein would climax onto a towel. I asked

conducting an investigation on Jeffrey Epstein and felt she may have
information pertaining to the investigation. Ms Bean identified
herself as Victoria Bean and resides in Wellington, Florida. She
advised approximately a year ago she was brought to Epstein's house to
provide a massage for money. Bean stated she needed to make money and
felt it was a quick way to make some money. Bean stated she was
brought to the house by ~arrison and was introduced to Epstein and his
assistant. She was brought to his main bathroom and provided a
massage. I asked her if she provided the massage naked. Bean stated
she did. She rubbed Epstein's legs, back and chest. I asked Bean if
Epstein touched her during the massage. She advised he did not,
howeyer he did masturbate himself as she rubbed his chest. Once he
climaxed the massage was over. She was paid her money and left the

On February 13 , 2006, I met with David Rodgers at 7318 Heathley Drive
in Lake Worth, Rodgers was identified as Epstein 's pilot. I spoke
with Rodgers who advised he has been employed with Epstein since 1991 .
He flies both planes for Epstein depending where he wants to fly to.
Rodgers was asked about passengers in the plane he flies. Rodgers
stated unless Epstein flew to his island off of St Thomas, there would
be no way of knowing who the passengers were. I mentioned a recent
flight to Ohio, where Rodgers flew to Ohio to pick up
Rodgers stated he recalled flying on several occasions and did
remember•••• Rodgers stated once he is in the cockpit, he does not
knqw who the passengers are. When he prepares the passenger
manifests, he lists Epstein and his assistants he knows by name, Sarah
and Adrianna. Rodgers stated he would list either female or male
passengers on the manifests only to keep a count on the passengers.
Mrs. Rodgers came into the living room and recommended that her
husband consult with an attorney. Mr. Rodgers agreed he would speak
with the family attorney to inform him of this questioning. I
explained to Mr. Rodgers that he was not the suspect in this
investigation and ceased all questions. Based on the fact Rodgers
could not advise who passengers were in the plane, I then left the

On May 10, 2006, information was received that Epstein's associate,
Leslie Wexner, The Limited Inc, CEO's, plane had arrived in West Palm
Beach, PBIA. The plane, a Gulfstream 4 bearing a N900LS registration,
was on the tarmac at Galaxy Aviation. As Epstein had recently
acquired the services of a new attorney, and the fact that Epstein's
house is. currently under remodeling, it was believed that Epstein may
be in Palm Beach. I conducted physical surveillance at the residence,
358 El Brillo Way. I observed a large construction crew conducting
remodeling at the house. The contractor, David Norr, was observed
driving a Ford Explorer, white in color. The vehicle has a Florida
registration of F30QQF. Norr left Epstein's house and traveled north
on County Road. Det Caristo and I conducted surveillance on Norr.
Norr traveled to several construction sites and checked on certain
jobs . Surveillance was discontinued on Norr and Det Caristo and I
traveled to Galaxy Aviation. I observed the white plane with a blue
stripe along the body and tail of the plane; the tail number was
visible on the bottom of the tail, closer to the body of the plane.
We maintained visual surveillance on the plane until 4:57 p.m., when a
caravan of Cadillac Escalades drove onto the tarmac. We observed
several people exit the vehicles and discovered that they were part of

County for an executive meeting for the day. They arrived in Palm
Beach County on May 9, 2006 at 9:30 pm and were scheduled to leave on

direct file, as so much time has elapsed since the original request to
the Grand Jury. I explained that the Palm Beach Police Department had
concluded the case in December of 2005 and has been waiting for the
case to go forward . Belohlavek stated the original offer was again
offered to the new defense attorney. She was waiting for their answer
by Friday May 19, 2006. She stated she would advise me of the answer .
