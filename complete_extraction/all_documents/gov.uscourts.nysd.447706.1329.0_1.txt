UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT
SOUTHERN DISTRICT OF NEW YORK
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE,
Plaintiff,
15 Civ. 7433 (LAP)
-against-
ORDER
GHISLAINE MAXWELL,
Defendant.
LORETTA A. PRESKA, Senior United States District Judge:
Before the Court are letter-motions filed by Intervenors
Julie Brown and Miami Herald Media Company, (dkt. no. 1321), and
Intervenor Alan Dershowitz, (dkt. no. 1323), seeking to unseal in
part docket entry 1026-3 to disclose the identities of the Jane
and John Does. For the reasons set forth below, the letter-motions
to unseal docket entry 1026-3 are DENIED.
First, docket entry 1026-3 is not an accurate list of
non-party names. Since this filing, the parties have provided the
Court with an updated list of non-party names (“Document”), and
disclosure of docket entry 1026-3, which is now outdated, would
therefore compound, not “avoid,” the “spread of incorrect
information.” (See dkt. no. 1321 at 2.)
Second, even so, the privacy interests at stake outweigh any
presumption of public access to the Document. The public does not
have an absolute right to access and inspect court documents;
rather, courts may exercise their supervisory power to ensure that
records are not used as “vehicle[s] for improper purposes,”
including, for example, “to promote public scandal.” See Nixon v.
Warner Commc’ns, Inc., 435 U.S. 589, 598 (1978); see also Brown v.
Maxwell, 929 F.3d 41, 51 (2d Cir. 2019) (explaining the same).
This Document is akin to a summary exhibit under Federal Rule of
Evidence 1006 — a mere aid prepared by the parties to assist the
Court in carrying out its work. It includes the Does’ names,
pseudonyms, home addresses, and the document(s) in which each Doe
appears. Importantly, the underlying documents, akin to the
evidence, have already been ordered unsealed with respect to most
of the Does.1 (See dkt. no. 1315.) Moreover, the Court’s
December 18 Order set forth an anonymized list of Does, the
documents in which each appears, and the Court’s reasoning for
granting or denying unsealing. Thus, disclosing the Document will
contribute nothing to the public’s information that is not already
knowable from the underlying documents and the Court’s December 18
Order.
At the same time, unsealing the Document poses a danger to
the privacy interests of the parties whose identities the Court
has declined to unseal. Even if those Does’ names were redacted
in an unsealed version of the Document, the alphabetical order of
1 With respect to the remaining Does, the Court has explained its
reasons for declining to unseal their names, and any party
dissatisfied with those reasons can appeal to the Court of Appeals.

the list could easily lead to speculation about the identities of
the as-yet-unnamed Does. This outcome is particularly likely in
the wake of the recent media frenzy about some supposed “Epstein
List” and the mass speculation about the identities of those on
it. The Document includes minor victims, health care providers,
members of law enforcement, and mere bystanders who have not sought
publicity on these matters, and the Court has already found that
their privacy interests outweigh any presumption of public access.
Those same reasons for denying unsealing continue to apply and to
outweigh the public’s interest in this Document.
Accordingly, the letter-motions to unseal in part docket
entry 1026-3 (dkt. nos. 1321, 1323) are DENIED.
SO ORDERED.
Dated: January 5, 2024
New York, New York
