1 wanted to know about the Prince Andrew incident.
2 Q So that's a different piece of paper?
3 A Yeah, that's just random paper.
4 Q So you had a green spiral notebook that
5 you began sometime in 2011 or 2012 in which you wrote
6 down your recollections about what had happened to
7 you, and you burned that in a bonfire in 2013.
8 Did I get that right?
9 A You got that right.
10 Q And do you have no other names of people
11 to whom you claim Ghislaine Maxwell directed you to
12 have sex, correct?
13 A At this time, no.
14 Q Is there any document that would refresh
15 your recollection that you could look at?
16 A If you have a document you'd like to show
17 me, I would be glad to look at it and tell you the
18 names I recognize off of that.
19 Q I'm just asking you if there's a document
20 you know of that has this list of names in it?
21 A Not in front of me, no.
22 Q Where is the original of the photograph
23 that has been widely circulated in the press of you
24 with Prince Andrew?
25 A I probably still have it. It's not in my

Case 1:15-cvA-0g7r4e3n3 -BLAlaPn d Doo Ccuomuretn Rt 1e3p2o0r-t3i0n g F &il eVdi d01e/o0,3 I/2n4c . Page 7 of 27
1 possession right now.
2 Q Where is it?
3 A Probably in some storage boxes.
4 Q Where?
5 A In Sydney.
6 Q Where in Sydney?
7 A At some family's house. We got the boxes
8 shipped to Australia, and they were picked up off the
9 porch by my nephews and brought to their house.
10 Q Which is where?
11 A In Sydney.
12 Q Where in Sydney?
13 A Bass Hill.
14 Q And who lives in that house?
15 A Well, it's owned by my mother-in-law and
16 father-in-law, but my nephews live in the house.
17 Q What are their names?
18 A I'm not giving you the names of my
19 nephews.
20 Q What's the address of the house?
21 A Why would you want that?
22 Q I want to know where the photograph is.
23 I'm asking you where the photograph is. And you've
24 just told me it's somewhere in Bass Hill?
25 A Yes.

1 Q So where in Bass Hill is the photograph
2 located?
3 A If I can't 100 percent say that the
4 photograph is there, it could be at my house that I
5 presently live in. I'm not going to give you the
6 address of my nephews' residence.
7 Q When is the last time you saw the
8 photograph in person?
9 A When I packed and left America.
10 Q Colorado?
11 A Yes.
12 Q All right. So you had that photograph
13 here with you in Colorado?
14 A Yes.
15 Q What's on the back of the photograph?
16 A I'm sorry?
17 Q Is there anything on the back of the
18 photograph?
19 A There's like the date it was printed, but
20 no writing or anything.
21 Q Okay. Does it say where it was printed?
22 A I don't believe so. I think it just I
23 don't remember. I just remember there's a date on
24 it.
25 Q Whose camera was it taken with?

1 A My little yellow Kodak camera.
2 Q Who took the picture?
3 A Jeffrey Epstein.
4 Q And where did you have it developed?
5 A I believe when I got back to America.
6 Q So where?
7 A I don't know.
8 Q Palm Beach?
9 A I don't know.
10 Q What is the date the photograph was
11 printed?
12 A I believe it's in March 2001.
13 Q Okay.
14 A But that's just off of my photographic
15 memory. I don't -- it could be different, but I
16 think it's March 2001.
17 Q You have a photographic memory?
18 A I'm not saying I have a photographic
19 memory. But if I'd look at the back of the photo and
20 I remember what it says, I believe it was March 2001.
21 Q Did the photograph ever leave your
22 possession for a while?
23 A I gave it to the FBI.
24 Q Okay. And when did you get it back?
25 A When they took copies of it.

1 Q When was that?
2 A 2011.
3 Q When they came to interview you?
4 A Yes.
5 Q So from 2011 until you left Colorado it
6 was in your personal possession?
7 A Yes.
8 Q What other documents related to this case
9 are in that, storage boxes in Australia?
10 MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
11 A Documents related to this case -- there
12 I don't know. I really can't tell you. I mean,
13 there's seven boxes full of Nerf guns, my kids' toys,
14 photos. I don't know what other documents would be
15 in there.
16 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did anyone search
17 those documents after you received discovery requests
18 from us in this case?
19 A I haven't been able to obtain those boxes.
20 I can't get them sent back up to me. It's going to
21 cost me a large amount of money. And right now I'm
22 trying to look after my family, so I'm not able to
23 afford to get them up.
24 Q You live in Australia, correct?
25 A I do.

1 Q Okay. How far away are the boxes from
2 where you live in Australia?
3 A Sydney is down here at the bottom. Cairns
4 is up here at the top.
5 Q Okay.
6 A It's probably a six-day drive.
7 Q Did you fly here through Sydney?
8 A No.
9 Q Have you been to Sydney since you've moved
10 back to Australia?
11 A I flew into Sydney with my three kids, but
12 it was a connecting flight to Brisbane.
13 Q Did you ask your nephews or anyone else to
14 search those boxes in response to discovery requests
15 that we issued in this case?
16 A They are my nephews. I would never let
17 them look at those.
18 Q Other than your green spiral notebook,
19 what else did you burn in this bonfire in 2013?
20 A That was it.
21 Q That's the only thing?
22 A Yes.
23 Q Did you use wood?
24 A Yes.
25 Q Charcoal?

1 A My husband built the bonfire out of wood
2 and I don't know what else he put in it. He's the
3 one who always makes the fires, not me.
4 Q Who else was present?
5 A Just him and I.
6 Q Were your kids there?
7 A No. They were inside sleeping.
8 Q And what beach was this?
9 A It wasn't a beach. It was in my backyard.
10 Q What's your address?
11 A At that time?
12 Q Um-hum.
13 A Jane Doe 2
14 Q Jane Doe 2
15 A Yes.
16 Q Who were your neighbors?
17 A Sweet people. Ray and -- I could look on
18 my phone if you want.
19 Q No, thank you. Do they still live there?
20 A Yes.
21 Q Do you keep in touch with them?
22 A Last time I talked to them was a few
23 months ago.
24 Q Did they see the fire?
25 A They've seen many fires that we've had.

1 We've had lots of bonfires there.
2 Q Did you ever ride in a helicopter with
3 Ghislaine Maxwell acting as pilot of the helicopter?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Who else was on the flight?
6 A I've been on the helicopter with her
7 plenty of times. I can't mention how many people
8 were on the -- on the helicopter at the same time.
9 Q How many times?
10 A I don't know. Do you have helicopter
11 records that you could show me?
12 Q I'm asking you how many times you were on
13 the helicopter with Ghislaine Maxwell acting as the
14 pilot -
15 A It's impossible for me to answer the
16 question without having the actual physical records
17 in front of me.
18 Q I'm asking you to look into your memory
19 and tell me how many times you recall being on a
20 helicopter with Ghislaine Maxwell at the pilot seat?
21 A There is no number I can give you.
22 There's plenty of times I've been on her helicopter.
23 Q Where did you go from and to on a
24 helicopter?
25 A I believe it was -- don't quote me on this

1 because I get confused on the islands there. I want
2 to say it was St. John's. It could have been
3 St. Barts. St. John or St. Barts, and then we would
4 fly straight to Jeffrey's island.
5 Q Okay. Did you ever go anywhere else on
the helicopter?
6
7 A No.
8 Q Were you ever on the helicopter with Bill
Clinton and Ghislaine Maxwell as the pilot of the
9
10 helicopter?
11 A No.
12 Q Were you ever on the helicopter with Bill
13 Clinton's Secret Service and Ghislaine Maxwell as the
14 pilot?
15 A No.
16 Q Do you recall telling Sharon Churcher that
17 you were?
18 A No.
19 Q Did you see the press article in which
20 Sharon Churcher reported that you were?
21 MR. EDWARDS: Objection. I'd just ask
22 that if you're going to ask this witness about a
23 specific article I'd like for her to see the article.
24 Otherwise she's not going to testify about it.
25 If you have something to show her, then,
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE 5/3/2016 216
Case 1:15-cv-A07g4r3e3n- LBAlPan dDoo cCuomuernt tR 1e3p20o-r3t0in g F &ile dV i0d1e/0o3, /I2n4c . Page 15 of 27
1 please.
2 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Do you recall seeing a
3 press article in which Sharon Churcher reported that
4 you were on a helicopter with Bill Clinton and
5 Ghislaine Maxwell as the pilot?
6 MR. EDWARDS: Again, I'll let you answer
7 the question once she's looking at the document that
8 you're being asked about.
9 MS. MENNINGER: You're not letting her
10 answer a question about whether she recalls a
11 particular press statement?
12 MR. EDWARDS: I will let her answer every
13 question about the press statement as long as she
14 sees the press statement. I'm okay with that. She
15 can answer all of them.
16 MS. MENNINGER: No, there is a rule of
17 civil procedure that allows you to direct a witness
18 not to answer a question when there's a claim of
19 privilege.
20 What privilege are you claiming to direct
21 her not to answer this question?
22 MR. EDWARDS: I thought that you wanted
23 accurate answers from this witness. If the
24 MS. MENNINGER: I asked her if she
25 recalled something --
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE 5/3/2016 217
Case 1:15-cv-A07g4r3e3n- LBAlPan dDoo cCuomuernt tR 1e3p20o-r3t0in g F &ile dV i0d1e/0o3, /I2n4c . Page 16 of 27
1 MR. EDWARDS: If the sole purpose is to
2 just to harass her --
3 MS. MENNINGER: I asked her if she
4 recalled something --
5 MR. EDWARDS: Then that's just not going
6 to be what's happening today.
7 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) All right. So you're
8 refusing to answer a question about whether you
9 recall a particular press statement
10 MR. EDWARDS: She's --
11 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) -- is that true?
12 MR. EDWARDS: She is not refusing to
13 answer any questions. She --
14 A I'm not refusing to answer. I just want
15 to see the article you're talking about so I can be
16 clear in my statement.
17 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Do you recall seeing a
18 press article written by Sharon Churcher reporting
19 that you flew on a helicopter with Bill Clinton and
20 Ghislaine Maxwell as the pilot?
21 A No, I do not recall reading a press
22 article saying that I was on a helicopter with Bill
23 Clinton as Ghislaine is the pilot.
24 Q Do you recall telling Sharon Churcher that
25 you had conversations with Bill Clinton regarding him
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE 5/3/2016 218
Case 1:15-cv-A07g4r3e3n- LBAlPan dDoo cCuomuernt tR 1e3p20o-r3t0in g F &ile dV i0d1e/0o3, /I2n4c . Page 17 of 27
1 flying on a helicopter with Ghislaine Maxwell?
2 A I believe that it was taken out of
3 context. Ghislaine told me that she flew Bill
4 Clinton in. And Ghislaine likes to talk a lot of
5 stuff that sounds fantastical. And whether it's true
6 or not, that is what I do recall telling Sharon
7 Churcher.
8 Q So you told Sharon Churcher that Ghislaine
9 Maxwell is the one who told you that she flew Bill
10 Clinton in the helicopter?
11 A I told Sharon Churcher that Ghislaine flew
12 Bill Clinton onto the island, based upon what
13 Ghislaine had told me.
14 Q Not based upon what Bill Clinton had told
15 you, correct?
16 A Correct.
17 Q Did you ever ask Sharon Churcher to
18 correct anything that was printed under her name,
19 concerning your stories to Sharon Churcher?
20 A I wasn't given those stories to read
21 before they were printed.
22 Q After they were printed did you read them?
23 A I tried to stay away from them. They were
24 very hard. You have to understand it was a very hard
25 time for me and my husband to have to have this

Case 1:15-cv-A07g4r3e3n- LBAlPan dDoo cCuomuernt tR 1e3p20o-r3t0in g F &ile dV i0d1e/0o3, /I2n4c . Page 18 of 27
1 public -- we didn't think it was going to be this
2 publicly announced and that big. So we turned off
3 the news and we stopped reading so many things.
4 Q You didn't read the articles about your
5 stories to Sharon Churcher
6 A I've read some articles
7 Q Let me just finish. You did not read the
8 articles published by Sharon Churcher about your
9 stories to Sharon Churcher?
10 A I have read some articles about what
11 Sharon Churcher wrote. And a lot of the stuff that
12 she writes she takes things from my own mouth and
13 changes them into her own words as journalists do.
14 And I never came back to her and told her
15 to correct anything. What was done was done. There
16 was nothing else I can do.
17 Q So even if she printed something that were
18 untrue you didn't ask her to correct it, correct?
19 A There was things that she printed that
20 really pissed me off, but there was nothing I could
21 do about it. It's already out there.
22 Q She printed things that were untrue,
23 correct?
24 MR. EDWARDS: Objection to the form.
25 Mischaracterization.

1 A I wouldn't say that they were untrue. I
2 would just say that she printed them as journalists
3 take your words and turn them into something else.
4 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) She got it wrong?
5 MR. EDWARDS: Object to the form.
6 Mischaracterization.
7 A In some ways, yes.
8 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did she print things
9 in her articles that you did not say to her?
10 MR. EDWARDS: I object and ask that the
11 witness be given the opportunity to see the document
12 so that she can review it and answer that question
13 accurately. Otherwise she's unable to answer the
14 question. I'm not going to allow her to answer.
15 MS. MENNINGER: You know the civil rules
16 tell you not to suggest answers to your client.
17 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) And you understand
18 your lawyer is now directing you to not all of a
19 sudden remember what your answer is. That's what
20 he's suggesting that you say. So you're not supposed
21 to listen to him suggest that to you. You're
22 supposed to tell me from your memory.
23 MR. EDWARDS: That is not what I'm -
24 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did you --
25 MR. EDWARDS: That's not what I'm doing.

1 You don't get to just talk over me and
2 tell my client when not to listen to me. All you
3 have to do to get answers is show her the document
4 you're talking about, and I'll let her answer every
5 question. I don't know why we're so scared of the
6 actual documents.
7 MS. MENNINGER: I don't know why you're
8 scared of your client's recollection, Mr. Edwards.
9 But anyway
10 MR. EDWARDS: Why would you do this to
11 her?
12 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did Sharon Churcher
13 print things that you did not say?
14 MR. EDWARDS: I'm going to instruct my
15 client not to answer unless you give her what it is
16 that you're talking about that was printed. And she
17 will tell you the answer, the accurate answer to your
18 question. Just without the document to refresh her
19 recollection and see it, she's not going to answer
20 the question.
21 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did Sharon Churcher
22 print things that you did not say?
23 MR. EDWARDS: Same objection. Same
24 instruction not to answer.
25 I think I've made a very clear record as
VIRGINIA GIUFFRE 5/3/2016 222
Case 1:15-cv-A07g4r3e3n- LBAlPan dDoo cCuomuernt tR 1e3p20o-r3t0in g F &ile dV i0d1e/0o3, /I2n4c . Page 21 of 27
1 to why I want my client to answer all of these
2 questions, but I want her to have the fair
3 opportunity to see this document.
4 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did Sharon Churcher
5 print things that you felt were inaccurate?
6 MR. EDWARDS: Same objection. Same
7 instruction. If she sees the document, she's going
8 to answer every one of these questions.
9 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did any other reporter
10 print statements that you believe are inaccurate?
11 MR. EDWARDS: Same objection. Same
12 instruction.
13 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) Did any reporter print
14 statements about Ghislaine Maxwell that were
15 inaccurate?
16 MR. EDWARDS: Same objection. Same
17 instruction.
18 This is harassing. This is harassing a
19 sexual abuse victim. And all I'm asking is for
20 fairness, that we just let her see the document so
21 she can answer this.
22 MS. MENNINGER: Mr. Edwards, please stop
23 saying anything other than an objection, what the

1 MS. MENNINGER: That's what the Federal
2 Rules of Civil Procedure provide.
3 MR. EDWARDS: I hear you. They also
4 provide for fairness and civility. And all I'm
5 asking, very calmly, is for her to see this.
6 MS. MENNINGER: Mr. Edwards, this is not
7 your deposition. I'm asking your client what she
8 remembers. If she doesn't want to talk about what
9 she remembers, then let her not answer. But you
10 cannot instruct her not to answer unless there's a
11 privilege.
12 What privilege --
13 MR. EDWARDS: I am instructing her not to
14 answer.
15 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) All right. You are
16 refusing to answer questions about whether statements
17 to the press about Ghislaine Maxwell attributed to
18 you were inaccurate?
19 MR. EDWARDS: She's not refusing not to
20 answer.
21 A You are refusing to show me these
22 documents so I could answer properly. I would give
23 you an answer if you were to show me some documents.
24 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) You can't say without
25 looking at a document whether the press attributed to

1 you is accurate or inaccurate?
2 A Please show me the document.
3 Q You can't say from the top of your head
4 whether any inaccurate statement has been attributed
5 to you in the press?
6 A Please show me a document and I will tell
7 you.
8 Q Are you refusing to answer my questions
9 about your knowledge of whether inaccurate statements
10 have been attributed to you in the press?
11 A Are you refusing to give me the documents
12 to look at?
13 Q Are you refusing to answer the question?
14 A I am refusing to answer the question based
15 upon the fact that you are not being fair enough to
16 let me see the document in order to give you an
17 honest answer.
18 Q Ms. Giuffre

2 Ghislaine Maxwell?

1 A Single sheets.
2 Q And did you write a long document or a
3 short document? What was it?
4 A I can't recall how long the document was,
5 but I would say it would be a few pages.
6 Q And other than asking you to write
7 whatever you remember about Prince Andrew, did she
8 give you any other directions about what you should
9 write?
10 A She was interested in two things, really.
11 How Epstein got away with so many counts of child
12 trafficking for sex and how Prince Andrew was
13 involved in it. Those were her two main inquiries.
14 Q What did she ask you to write?
15 A She asked me to write about Prince Andrew.
16 Q Did she tell you to put it in your own
17 handwriting?
18 A No, she just asked me to write down what I
19 can remember.
20 Q Did you give her everything that you
21 wrote?
22 A Did I give her the whole entire pages that
23 I wrote?
24 Q Yes.
25 A Yeah, I wrote pages for her specifically.
