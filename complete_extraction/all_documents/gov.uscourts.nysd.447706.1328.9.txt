II. Applicable Standards
Rule 26 "create[s] many options for the district judge .
[to] manage the discovery process to facilitate prompt and
efficient resolution of the lawsuit." Crawford-El v. Britton,
523 U.S. 574, 599, 118 S. Ct. 1584, 1597, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759
(1998). It "vests the trial judge with broad discretion to
tailor discovery narrowly and to dictate the sequence of
discovery." Crawford-El v. Britton, 523 U.S. 574, 598, 118 S.
5
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 7 of 21
Ct. 1584, 1597, 140 L. Ed. 2d 759 (1998). The District Court may
expand or limit the permitted number and time limits of
depositions, direct "the time, place, and manner of discovery,
or even bar discovery on certain subjects," and may "set the
timing and sequence of discovery." Id. at 598-99; Fed. R. Civ.
P. 26(b)(2)(A).
Consequently, the Court has wide discretion in deciding
motions to compel. See Grand Cent. P'ship. Inc. v. Cuomo, 166
F.3d 473, 488 (2d Cir.1999). Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26
states:
Parties may obtain discovery regarding any nonprivileged
matter that is relevant to any party's claim or defense
including the existence, description, nature, custody,
condition, and location of any documents or other tangible
things and the identity and location of persons who know of
any discoverable matter. For good cause, the court may
order discovery of any matter relevant to the subject
matter involved in the action.
Fed. R. Civ. P. 26. If a party objects to discovery requests,
that party bears the burden of showing why discovery should be
denied. Freydl v. Meringolo, 09 Civ. 07196 (BSJ) (KNF), 2011 WL
256608-7, at *3 (S.D.N.Y. June 16, 2011).

III. The Motion For an Order of Forensic Examination Is Granted
in Part and Denied in Part
Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 2 6 ( f) ( 3) ( C) requires the
parties to state their views and proposals as to preservation of
electronically stored information ("ESI") and the form of
production of ESL Fed. R. Civ. P. 26(f) (3) (C). Defendant having
admitted to deletion practices that indicate relevant documents
and also refused to detail document search methods, good cause
exists to warrant court supervised examination of her electronic
devices. Accordingly, Plaintiff's motion is granted in part.
Defendant is ordered to collect all ESI by imaging her
computers and collecting all email and text messages on any
devices in Defendant's possession or to which she has access
that Defendant used between the period of 2002 to present.
Defendant is further directed to run mutually-agreed upon search
terms related to Plaintiff's requests for production over the
aforementioned ESI and produce responsive documents within 21
days of distribution of this opinion.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 9 of 21
IV. The Motion to Compel Plaintiff to Disclose Ongoing Criminal
Investigations is Denied
The public interest privilege "exists to encourage
witnesses to come forward and provide information in criminal
investigations carried out by [law enforcement] without
fear that the information will be disclosed." Sanchez by Sanchez
v. City of New York, 201 A.D.2d 325, 326, 607 N.Y.S.2d 321
(1994). A party seeking disclosure of such information "first
must demonstrate a compelling and particularized need for
access" beyond "[g]eneral and conclusory allegations." Id. The
Court then weighs application of the qualified privilege by
balancing the need for production against the potential harm to
the public from disclosure. Id.
After review of the materials in camera, the qualified
public interest privilege as set forth in Sanchez has been
established with respect to the submitted documents. Defendant
has articulated no need for the documents. Accordingly, the
balance weighs in favor of the privilege, and the motion to
compel is denied. To preserve the record, Plaintiff is directed
to file under seal a comprehensive copy of the log and documents
within 21 days of distribution of this opinion.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 10 of 21
V. The Motion to Compel Defendant to Answer Deposition
Questions is Granted
Plaintiff seeks to compel Defendant to answer questions
regarding her knowledge of adult sexual activity, which defense
counsel instructed Defendant not to answer during her deposition.
"Where a party objects to a discovery request, the
objecting party bears the burden of demonstrating specifically
how, despite the broad and liberal construction afforded the
federal discovery rules, each request is not relevant or how each
question is overly broad, burdensome or oppressive by submitting
affidavits or offering evidence revealing the nature of the
burden." John Wiley & Sons, Inc. v. Book Dog Books, LLC, 298
F.R.D. 184, 186 (S.D.N.Y. 2014) (citations, internal quotation
marks and brackets omitted).
Defendant has submitted that she has not put her private
affairs at issue, and that such questions are highly intrusive.
Notwithstanding, the questions are directed to reveal relevant
answers regarding Defendant's knowledge of Plaintiff's
allegations. That knowledge goes directly to the truth or falsity
of the alleged defamation, a key element of Plaintiff's claim.
9
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 11 of 21
Furthermore, privacy concerns are alleviated by the protective
order in this case, drafted by Defendant.
Defendant is ordered to answer questions relating to
Defendant's own sexual activity (a) with or involving Jeffrey
Epstein ("Epstein"), (b) with or involving Plaintiff, (c) with or
involving underage females known to Epstein or who Defendant
believed or intended might become known to Epstein, or (d)
involving or including massage with individuals Defendant knew to
be, or believed might become, known to Epstein. Defendant is also
directed to answer questions relating to her knowledge of sexual
activities of others (a) with or involving Epstein, (b) with or
involving Plaintiff, (c) with or involving underage females known
to Epstein or who Defendant believed were known or might become
known to Epstein, or (d) involving or including massage with
individuals Defendant knew to be or believed might become known
to Epstein. 1 The scope of Defendant's answers are not bound by
time period, though Defendant need not answer questions that
relate to none of these subjects or that is clearly not relevant,
such as sexual activity of third-parties who bear no knowledge or
relation to the key events, individuals, or locations of this
case.
1 Each of the aforementioned lists are disjunctive.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 12 of 21
VI. The Motion to Compel Non-Privileged Documents is Granted in
Part and Denied in Part
Defendant has sought to compel the following documents: (1)
attorney-client communications regarding media advice; (2) pre
existing documents transmitted to counsel; (3) documents shared
with or communicated to unidentified third parties; (4)
documents primarily for the purpose of providing business
advice; (5) documents subject to an unidentified common interest
or joint defense protection.
Plaintiff has represented that all responsive "attachments"
Defendant seeks to compel have been produced. Accordingly, this
request is denied.
Defendant seeks to compel attorney-client communications
I that include "third parties" on the basis that Plaintiff's
privilege log is deficient for identifying individuals as
"professionals retained by attorneys to aid in the rendition of
legal advice." A review of Plaintiff's privilege log shows
Plaintiff has expressly claimed privilege, described the nature
of the withheld documents, communications, and tangible things
not produced, and generally logged communications in compliance
with Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 26 (b) (5) (A) (ii). "Unless
11
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 13 of 21
the client waives privilege, an attorney or his or her employee,
or any person who obtains without the knowledge of the client
evidence of a confidential communication made between the
attorney or his or her employee and the client in the course of
professional employment, shall not disclose, or be allowed to
disclose such communication, nor shall the client be compelled
to disclose such communication." N.Y. C.P.L.R. 4503 (McKinney)
(emphasis added). The conduct explicitly described by statute as
privileged does not operate as waiver, and again Defendant has
provided no factual basis to suggest Plaintiff has
misrepresented the identity or role of the third-parties listed.
Defendant's request is denied.
Defendant's challenge to the common interest privilege
claims is likewise unavailing. Regardless of whether Plaintiff
has reflexively claimed the common interest privilege in each
entry does not vitiate the otherwise applicable privilege claims
made, and Defendant has provided no factual foundation to
establish waiver or failure of the other claimed privileges.
Finally, with respect to the media and business advice
communications, Defendant has marshaled no evidence to support
her speculation that the documents logged as privileged are
improperly withheld other than the fact that one member of
12
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 14 of 21
Plaintiff's legal team is an author. Plaintiff has represented
to the Court and via a detailed privilege log that the
communications in question are privileged. Stan Pottinger, the
author in question, is a barred attorney of record in this case,
incomparable to Defendant's media agent (and non-attorney) Ross
Gow. That Pottinger has written non-legal material, or even
whether his "primary occupation in the most recent years [is] as
a novelist," is irrelevant to whether his communication with
Plaintiff as her counsel was for the purpose of providing legal
advice. Similarly, Bradley Edwards, who Defendant has already
challenged, is an attorney of record in this case, and Defendant
has provided no evidence other than the fact of his
representation of Plaintiff's non-profit to doubt that the
communications logged are privileged.
Having provided no grounds to doubt the sworn
representations of Plaintiff's counsel, Defendant's motion to
compel these communications is denied. Defendant is granted
leave to refile the motions with respect to media and business
advice on the basis of relevant and non-specious factual
support. Court intervention should not be invoked to resolve
routine discovery matters on the basis of a supposition of bad
faith. Further filing of frivolous or vexatious motions lacking
sufficient factual support to support a colorable argument (or
13
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 15 of 21
on the basis of misrepresented or false facts or law) will be
met with sanctions.
VII. The Motion for Leave to Serve Three Deposition Subpoenas By
Means Other than Personal Service is Granted in Part and Denied
in Part
Plaintiff seeks to compel subpoenas to serve Nadia
Marcinkova, Sarah Kellen, and Jeffrey Epstein. The request is
denied with respect to Epstein as moot. No opposition having
been filed and the testimony of Marcinkova and Kellen being
relevant to falsity of the defamation at issue, the motion is
granted with respect to Marcinkova and Kellen.
VIII. The Motion to Compel Attorney-Client Communications
and Work Product is Denied
Defendant argues that "Edwards and Cassell preemptively
filed an action against Dershowitz proclaiming they did not
violate Rule 11 [and i]n doing so, they voluntarily put at
issue and relied on: a) their good faith reliance on information
communicated to them by Plaintiff, and b) their work product
14
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 16 of 21
showing that their filing was reasonably investigated and
substantially justified." Def.'s Reply in Supp. Mot. to Compel
all Att'y-Client Comms. and Att'y Work Product at 8-9 (Def.'s
Reply on AC"). The Broward County, Florida Court ruled on this
argument in Edwards and Cassell v. Dershowitz and Defendant
argues in reply that this order is non-binding, and was issued
prior to Plaintiff's testimony. Id. at 1.
Defendant was not a party to the Florida case.
Nevertheless, Defendant's argument is nearly identical to
Dershowitz's. Defendant argues Plaintiff's testimony arose after
the ruling in the Florida case, however, the principle of that
argument is the same: Defendant placed her attorney-client
communications with Edwards and Cassell at issue by relying on
the content of those communications in Edwards and Cassell v.
Dershowitz. The Florida Court's ruling is therefore highly
relevant privilege has not been waived. 2 The motion is
accordingly denied.
2 The Court declines to address the choice of law issue, as
application of Florida or New York at-issue doctrines are not
outcome determinative in this instance and thus no determination
is necessary. Compare Coates v. Akerman, Senterfitt & Eidson,
P.A., 940 So. 2d 504, 510 (Fla. Dist. Ct. App. 2006) ("for
waiver to occur under the at issue doctrine, the proponent of a
privilege must make a claim or raise a defense based upon the
privileged matter and the proponent must necessarily use the
privileged information in order to establish its claim or
defense.") with Chin v. Rogoff & Co., P.C., No. 05 CIV.
15
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 17 of 21
IX. The Motion to Exceed the Ten Deposition Limit is Granted in
Part and Denied in Part
As of the filing of Plaintiff's reply on June 13, 2016,
Plaintiff has deposed Defendant, Ms. Sjoberg, Mr. Alessi, Mr.
Rodgers, and Mr. Rizzo and scheduled the depositions of Mr.
Epstein, Mr. Gow, .JaneDoe2_, Ms. Kellen, Ms. Marcinkova, Mr.
Recarey, and Mr. Brunel. Plaintiff now seeks leave of the Court
pursuant to Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 30(2) (A) (i) take
three additional depositions: Mrs. Alessi, Mr. Reiter, and newly
raised in Plaintiff's reply, Former President Clinton.
Discovery being well under way and depositions having been
scheduled for more than ten individuals, the motion is timely.
"The court must grant a request to exceed ten depositions unless
the additional depositions would be unreasonably cumulative or
duplicative, the requesting party had a prior opportunity in
discovery to obtain the information sought, or the burden or
8360(NRB), 2008 WL 2073934, at *5 (S.D.N.Y. May 8, 2008) ("New
York courts have held that an 'at issue' waiver occurs "where a
party affirmatively places the subject matter of its own
privileged communication at issue in litigation, so that
invasion of the privilege is required to determine the validity
of a claim or defense of the party asserting the privilege, and
application of the privilege would deprive the adversary of
vital information.").
16
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-9 Filed 01/05/24 Page 18 of 21
expense of additional depositions would outweigh any likely
benefit." In re Weatherford Int'l Sec. Litig., No. 11 CIV. 1646
LAK JCF, 2013 WL 5762923, at *2 (S.D.N.Y. Oct. 24, 2013).
Plaintiff proposes limiting the length of the proposed
depositions to limit any undue burden that might result.
Defendant argues the depositions would be unduly cumulative and
duplicative.
This case revolves around factual issues between Plaintiff
and Defendant. The testimony of Mrs. Alessi concerning relevant
facts may tend to either establish or negate falsity of the
allegedly defamatory statement. The limited burden of this
additional deposition, further mitigated as Plaintiff proposes,
is therefore outweighed by the benefit of resolving this case on
the merits. The motion with respect to this additional
deposition is granted.
The relevance of the testimony of Mr. Reiter and President
Clinton have not been adequately established. The motion as to
these two depositions is denied. Defendant's request for costs
and fees is denied pursuant to this Court's previous ruling with
respect to costs and fees.

•
X. The Motion for Leave to File Excess Pages is Granted
Plaintiff sought leave to file excess pages in response to
Defendant's motion to compel attorney-client communications and
work product. To the extent the motion is not moot, leave is
granted.
XI. Conclusion
As set forth above: the motion for an order of forensic
examination is granted in part and denied in part; the motion to
compel to compel Plaintiff to disclose alleged on-going criminal
investigations by law enforcement is denied; the motion to
compel Defendant to answer deposition questions is granted; the
motion to compel non-privileged documents is denied; the motion
for leave to serve three deposition subpoenas by means other
than personal service is granted in part and denied in part; the
motion to compel attorney-client communications and work product
is denied; the motion to exceed the presumptive ten deposition
limit is granted; the motion for leave to file an opposition
brief in excess of the 25 pages permitted under this Court's
Individual Rules of Practice is granted. This opinion resolves
ECF Nos. 96, 101, 143, 155, 160, 164, 172, and 182.
