18 MR. PAGLIUCA: Same objections.
19 A. I have a number of friends that

21 kids and in the invitation of my friends and
22 their kids, I'm sure I may have invited some
23 of my friend's kids to come.

2 absolutely everything that took place in that
3 first meeting. She has lied repeatedly,
4 often and is just an awful fantasist. So
5 very difficult for anything to take place
6 that she repeated because I was with her
7 mother the entire time.
8 Q. So did you have -- did you give a

10 during the first time Virginia Roberts was at

5 It's absolute rubbish.
6 Q. Were you in charge of hiring
7 individuals to provide massages for Jeffrey
8 Epstein?
9 A. My job included hiring many people.
10 There were six homes. As I sit here, I hired
11 assistants, I hired architects, I hired
12 decorators, I hired cooks, I hired cleaners,
13 I hired gardeners, I hired pool people, I
14 hired pilots, I hired all sorts of people.
15 In the course and a very small part
16 of my job was from from time to time to find
17 adult professional massage therapists for
18 Jeffrey.
19 Q. When you say adult professional
20 massage therapists, where did you find these
21 massage therapists?
22 A. From time to time I would visit
23 professional spas, I would receive a massage
24 and if the massage was good I would ask that
25 man or woman if they did home visits.
