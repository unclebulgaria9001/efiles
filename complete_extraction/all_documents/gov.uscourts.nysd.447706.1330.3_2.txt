D. Computation of damages:
1. Physical, psychological and psychiatric injuries and resulting medical expenses - in
an amount of approximately $ 102,200 present value.
a. Computation Analysis:
1. Giuffre has had to receive treatment for the psychological harm as a
result of Maxwell's conduct towards Giuffre.
11. The average annual expenditures for mental health services for adults
18-64 in the United States is $1,751.
Giuffre needs continuing care as a result of the harm she has suffered.
111.
Ms. Giuffre was born August 9, 1983 and was 31.4 years old at the
beginning of 2015 when the alleged harm occurred. The average
remaining life expectancy for a 31 year old female is 51.1 years.
1v. Based on a remaining life expectancy of 51.1 years, annual healthcare
cost growth of 3.3% and a discount rate of 2.7%, the present value of
expected treatment costs is $102,200 as of 1/1/2015.

damages, and will provide further information through expert
disclosure.
2. Past, present and future pain and suffering, mental anguish, humiliation,
embarrassment, loss of self-esteem, loss of standing in the community, loss of
dignity and invasion of privacy in her public and private life not less than
$30,000,000.00.
a. Computation Analysis
1. Under New York law, defamation per se as alleged in this case
presumes damages and special damages do not need to be plead and
proven. See Celle v. Filipino Reporter Enterprises Inc., 209 F.3d 163,
179 (2nd Cir. 2000) (Second Circuit holding that '[i]f a statement is
defamatory per se, injury is assumed. In such a case 'even where the
plaintiff can show no actual damages at all, a plaintiff who has
otherwise shown defamation may recover at least nominal damages'
and the Second Circuit also confirmed an award of punitive
damages). Ms. Giuffre has been severely damaged by the defamation
of the defendant, by calling her claims of sexual abuse "obvious lies".
The defamation caused Ms. Giuffre to re-live the sexual abuse she
previously endured. Ms. Giuffre has suffered and continues to suffer
from the pain, mental anguish, humiliation, embarrassment, loss of
self-esteem, loss of standing in the community, loss of dignity and
invasion of privacy in her public and private life. The computation of
this amount is in the province of the jury but Ms. Giuffre contends,
including but not limited to, awards in other similar matters, that the
amount is not less than $30,000,000.00. Ms. Giuffre is in the process
of retaining an expert, and will provide further information through
expert disclosure.

1v. Ms. Giuffre is in the process of retaining an expert, and will provide

3. Punitive Damages -to be based upon all relevant factors, including the egregious
nature of Defendant, Ghislaine Maxwell's conduct and the need for a large award to
punish and deter conduct in view of the vast wealth of Defendant Maxwell, in an
amount not less than $50,000,000.00.
a. This calculation is in the province of the jury.
