16 looking for someone to hire.
17 Q. And what did you discuss with her?
18 A. I told her where she could go to -- you
19 know, to put up a listing. And then she asked me if

23 to be?
24 A. She explained that she lived in Palm Beach

1 And so she just liked to hire girls to work at the
2 house, answer phones, get drinks, do the job a
3 butler would do.
4 Q. And did she tell you what she would pay
5 for that kind of a job?

7 yes.
8 Q. And what did she say?
9 A. Twenty dollars an hour.
10 Q. Was there anybody else with Ms. Maxwell

14 was.
15 Q. And what happened next?
16 A. And then she asked me if I would be
17 interested in working for her. And she told me that
18 she was -- I could trust her and that I could jump
19 in her car and go check out the house at that moment
20 if I wanted.
21 And so I said, Sure, let's do it, and went
22 to her home with her.
23 Q. And where was that home?
24 A. In Palm Beach.
25 Q. And did she describe that home as being

2 answering phones and doing --
3 A. Just that one day.
4 Q. Just that one day.

7 asked me if I wanted to come over and make $100 an
8 hour rubbing feet.
9 Q. And what did you think of that offer?
10 A. I thought it was fantastic.
11 Q. And did you come over to the house for
12 that purpose?

14 Q. And when you came over to the house, was
15 Maxwell present?
16 A. I don't recall.
17 Q. And what happened that second time you
18 came to the house?
19 A. At that point, I met Emmy Taylor, and she
20 took me up to Jeffrey's bathroom and he was present.
21 And her and I both massaged Jeffrey. She was
22 showing me how to massage.
23 And then she -- he took -- he got off the
24 table, she got on the table. She took off her
25 clothes, got on the table, and then he was showing

1 me moves that he liked. And then I took my clothes
2 off. They asked me to get on the table so I could
3 feel it. Then they both massaged me.
4 Q. So it was more than a foot massage at that
5 point?
6 A. Yeah, it was mostly, like, legs and back.
7 Q. Was everybody in the room without clothes
8 on?
9 A. When they were on the massage table, yes.
10 Q. Did they -- when they got off the massage
11 table to perform the massage, did they dress or
12 did --

1 A. No, I only -- to you, I said that to you.
2 I just saw her as perhaps someone who may not have
3 had a strong family, and they took her under their
4 wing.
5 Q. Now, you mentioned remembering going to
6 Atlantic City.
7 Did you go -- where did you go after
8 Atlantic City?
9 A. Once we landed in New York, Emmy and I
10 went in a car and drove around the city for a half
11 hour or so, just to see some of the city.
12 Q. And then where did you go after doing the
13 sightseeing?
14 A. We went to the townhouse on East 71st.
15 Q. And can you describe that location for me?
16 A. Sure. Between Madison and Park. I think
17 the address might have been 9 East 71st Street.
18 Q. And who owned that home?
19 A. As far as I knew, Epstein.
20 Q. Can you describe for me physically what --
21 A. Palatial. When you walk up, it looks like
22 a normal door to a townhouse, and when you walk
23 in -- I thought there were four floors. I heard
24 there were seven floors. I didn't see them all.
25 Q. And do you recall who, if anybody, was at

1 Jeffrey's home when you arrived?
2 A. Yes. When I first walked in the door, it
3 was just myself, and Ghislaine headed for the
4 staircase and said -- told me to come up to the
5 living room.
6 Q. And what happened at that point, when you
7 came up to the living room?
8 A. I came up and saw Virginia, Jeffrey,
9 Prince Andrew, Ghislaine in the room.
10 Q. And did you meet Prince Andrew at that
11 time?
12 A. Yes.
13 Q. And what happened next?
14 A. At one point, Ghislaine told me to come
15 upstairs, and we went into a closet and pulled out
16 the puppet, the caricature of Prince Andrew, and
17 brought it down. And there was a little tag on the
18 puppet that said "Prince Andrew" on it, and that's
19 when I knew who he was.
20 Q. And did -- what did the puppet look like?
21 A. It looked like him. And she brought it
22 down and presented it to him; and that was a great
23 joke, because apparently it was a production from a
24 show on BBC. And they decided to take a picture
25 with it, in which Virginia and Andrew sat on a

2 sat on Andrew's lap, and they put the puppet's hand
3 on Virginia's breast, and Andrew put his hand on my

10 Q. And Ms. Maxwell was present during the --
11 was Ms. Maxwell present during that?

13 Q. What happened next?

15 shown to which room I was going to be staying in.
16 Q. When you exited the room that you were in
17 where the picture was taken, do you recall who
18 remained in that room?
19 A. I don't.
20 Q. Do you recall seeing Virginia exit that

7 during that massage?

9 nipples while he masturbated.
10 Q. And did that take place?
11 A. It did not.
12 Q. And why not?
13 A. I was not comfortable with it. And so I
14 left the room.
15 Q. Did you have any -- did you say anything
16 to him before leaving the room?
17 A. I believe I said, "I'm done."
18 Q. Do you recall what his reaction was to
19 that?
20 A. I do not. At the time, at that moment, I
21 do not.
22 Q. Did you recall later what --

24 later, talking about his expectations, and that was

2 She then asked me if I knew anyone, and I
3 didn't know who she was, I didn't want to take the
4 responsibility of finding someone to work for her,
5 and so I said, Sorry, I don't.
6 And then she said, Well, maybe what about
7 you?
8 And I was at a point in life, I was super
9 spontaneous and willing to skip school.
10 So she said, Come to my house, come in my
11 car and check it out.
12 And so I did.
13 Q. Okay. So for those of you -- of us who
14 don't know, is this like a college campus, like a
15 traditional college campus, or is it in a city
16 setting?
17 A. It's in a city setting. I mean, Palm
18 Beach is not a big city. So it's on the
19 Intracoastal, and there was a big grassy area that
20 were surrounded by buildings, so she was inside of
21 the campus.
22 Q. And she was looking for a bulletin board
23 where she could post a job?
24 A. Something like that, yes.
25 Q. Did she have any kind of flyers --

1 Q. How much?
2 A. One hundred dollars extra.
3 Can I clarify?
4 Q. Absolutely.
5 A. He didn't ever say he would pay me more,
6 but when the massage was more than just a massage
7 and it was sexual, then he would pay me more.
8 Q. It wasn't a discussion; it's just what
9 happened?
10 A. Correct.
11 Q. Thank you for clarifying.
12 The things that took place with you and
13 Jeffrey behind closed doors were when you were a
14 consenting adult, correct?
15 A. Yes.
16 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
17 THE WITNESS: Correct.
18 BY MS. MENNINGER:
19 Q. And you did not have knowledge of what

1 story out, because this is when Dershowitz --
2 Dershowitz was saying nothing was happening and
3 he was calling her a liar. And she was just
4 trying to find people to back up her story.
5 BY MS. MENNINGER:
6 Q. And what did you understand her story to
7 be? Did she tell you?
8 A. That she was recruited to give massages,
9 sexual massages, and have sex with people such as
10 Dershowitz and Andrew. But I knew none of that at
11 the time.
12 Q. Right. Did you tell them anything -- did
13 you tell them during that meeting that you knew of
14 anything about her being recruited to give sex to
15 either Jeffrey or to other people?
16 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
17 THE WITNESS: Can you rephrase?
18 BY MS. MENNINGER:
19 Q. Yes. That wasn't a very good question.
20 What did you say during this meeting with
21 Virginia and her investigator?
22 A. Basically that I believed her, even though
23 I -- she never spoke to me specifically about what
24 was going on; that once I learned everything that
25 happened based on reading the police report, I

1 believed her side of the story.
2 Q. And did she tell you what her side of the
3 story was?
4 A. You know, just that she wasn't a liar;
5 that, you know, she was there to have sex with men
6 that Jeffrey wanted her to sleep with.
7 Q. Did she tell you in that meeting who she
8 had sex with?
9 A. No.
10 Q. Did she name any of the famous people?
11 A. Only Dershowitz came up.
12 Q. Did you two talk about the incident in New
13 York with the puppet?
14 A. I don't recall.
15 Q. And you formed this opinion about whether
16 she was a liar based on things that you've read in
17 the police report?
18 MS. McCAWLEY: Objection.
19 THE WITNESS: I formed my opinion based on
20 my experience in the house.
21 BY MS. MENNINGER:
22 Q. Okay. And what experience in the house
23 helped you form your opinion that what Virginia is
24 saying is true?

17 with a camera that Ghislaine Maxwell had given you.
18 I want to ask you some questions about that.
19 A. Sure.
20 Q. Do you know when that was?
21 A. That was in 2002.
22 Q. And why does that date stick out?
23 A. Because I was living -- where I was living
24 specifically and where I had the phone call.
25 Q. Tell me what you remember about the
MAGNA9
LEGAL SERVICES
Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-12 Filed 01/05/24 Page 29 of 35

1 conversation.
2 A. I had been over to her house prior
3 massaging Jeffrey. And I got a phone call from her,
4 and she told me she had a camera for me for my
5 photography class, but yet, she couldn't give it to
6 me yet because during the massage I didn't finish my
7 job and she had to finish it for me.
8 Q. Did she say what she meant?
9 A. No, but I knew.
10 Q. Was there any other time that you had

1 exposed her bra, and she grabbed it and pulled it
2 down.
3 Q. Anything else?
4 A. That was the conversation that he had told
5 her that he had taken this girl's virginity, the
6 girl by the pool.
7 Q. Okay. Did Maxwell ever say to you that it
8 takes the pressure off of her to have other girls
9 around?
10 A. She implied that, yes.
11 Q. In what way?
12 A. Sexually.
13 Q. And earlier Laura asked you, I believe, if
14 Maxwell ever asked you to perform any sexual acts,
15 and I believe your testimony was no, but then you
16 also previously stated that during the camera
17 incident that Maxwell had talked to you about not
18 finishing the job.
19 Did you understand "not finishing the job"
20 meaning bringing Jeffrey to orgasm?
21 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.
22 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
23 Q. I'm sorry, Johanna, let me correct that
24 question.
25 What did you understand Maxwell to mean

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1328-12 Filed 01/05/24 Page 31 of 35

1 when she said you hadn't finished the job, with
2 respect to the camera?
3 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form.
4 THE WITNESS: She implied that I had not
5 brought him to orgasm.
6 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
7 Q. So is it fair to say that Maxwell expected
8 you to perform sexual acts when you were massaging
9 Jeffrey?
10 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, leading, form,
11 foundation.
12 THE WITNESS: I can answer?
13 Yes, I took that conversation to mean that
14 is what was expected of me.
15 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
16 Q. And then you mentioned, I believe, when
17 you were testifying earlier that Jeffrey told you a
18 story about sex on the plane. What was that about?
19 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, hearsay.
20 THE WITNESS: He told me one time Emmy was
21 sleeping on the plane, and they were getting
22 ready to land. And he went and woke her up,
23 and she thought that meant he wanted a blow
24 job, so she started to unzip his pants, and he
25 said, No, no, no, you just have to be awake for

2 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
3 Q. Do you recall witnessing any sexual acts
4 on the plane?
5 A. No.
6 Q. Did Emmy ever talk to you about performing
7 sexual acts on the plane?
8 A. No.
9 Q. We looked earlier at the police report,
10 and I just want to clarify, you identified some
11 areas where there were discrepancies in that report.
12 And you can take another look at it if you
13 want, but other than the discrepancies you pointed
14 out, is that a recollection of what you remember
15 telling the detective?
16 A. Yes.
17 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, outside the
18 scope of cross.
19 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
20 Q. You mentioned that there was a time when
21 you noticed that Maxwell was around a little bit
22 less?
23 A. Uh-huh.
24 Q. And I believe you said that was during the
25 middle of the time you were with Jeffrey.

1 Do you remember approximately when that
2 was year-wise?
3 A. I don't. I would say it was probably
4 sometime between 2003 and 2004.
5 Q. And what made you think that?
6 A. I just saw her less and less at the house.
7 Q. Were you there more at the house during
8 that time period?
9 A. No, not necessarily. It's just at the
10 beginning, she was around a lot. And then I would
11 see her occasionally without him. The one time we
12 spent a few days together in 2006, she wasn't there
13 at all.
14 Q. So you saw her in the -- is it fair to say
15 that you saw her in the 2005 and 2006 time frame?
16 A. Yes.
17 Q. Then we were talking about the photography
18 earlier and about the photographs.
19 Did Maxwell ever ask you to take nude
20 photos of yourself for Jeffrey?
21 A. She asked me to take photos of myself for
22 Jeffrey, yes.
23 Q. And did you do that?
24 A. I did not.
25 Q. And the photos that were around that were

1 in the bathroom, that you mentioned a couple of
2 times places that there were photos of you, who took
3 those?
4 A. He did.
5 Q. And when we were talking about the Palm
6 Beach house and you were describing an area where
7 there were just a lot of photographs, is it fair to
8 say that there could have been nude photographs
9 amongst those photos that you saw?
10 A. Yes.
11 Q. And earlier you testified that you don't
12 have knowledge of what happens behind closed doors,
13 but you also said that Jeffrey had told you what
14 other girls did for him and that he wanted you to do
15 those things for him.
16 Is it fair to say that you knew that other
17 girls were performing sexual acts?
18 A. Yes.
19 MS. MENNINGER: Objection, foundation,
20 form.
21 BY MS. McCAWLEY:
22 Q. And I know you mentioned previously that
23 your relationship and the interaction with him
24 progressed over time.
