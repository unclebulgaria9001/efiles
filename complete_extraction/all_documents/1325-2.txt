Hi shazza,
That will be great if we can arrange the wire tomorrow, much appreciated
buddy! If you don't mind my husband and I would like to be alone with the
phone conversation taking place tomorrow, we just have some serious things
to think about and our families well being comes first. I'll fill you in
over lunch tomorrow. We were thinking of meeting you at The entrance
instead. There's really nice alfresco dining and great for the kids to
play. What do you think? See you then ...
Take care,
Jenna

Dear Ms. Villafana:
I am sending you this email on a strictly background, not for attribution
basis. I will not disclose it nor any future communications between us
without your explicit permission.
Virginia Roberts has asked me to give you her cell phone number.
She is in Australia, JaneDoe2
I am copying her in by email but she will be grateful any initial contact
with her is by phone. She is 16 hours ahead of EST. A good time for her to
speak is nine am her time tomorrow (Monday your time).
Virginia would prefer me to be present when you initiate communication with
her. We both realize that any such communication must be in confidence. I
will be there for support, not as a journalist.

I am sure you understand that it has been a big step for her coming
forward. She has 3 young children and a husband and has concerns about
whether she is compromising their well-being.
I am a former investigative reporter for New York Magazine where my
colleagues included Nick Pileggi. I understand the sensitivity of this
situation.
Frankly, if I still worked there, I would publish everything that I believe
happened to Virginia and that now may be happening to a new generation of
minors.
But I now run the NY bureau for a UK paper and I am restrained because of
the UK's libel laws.
So Virginia and I are putting our trust in you.
Best regards,
Sharon Churcher

Darling Jenna and Rob,
Thank you so much for breakfast...and for finally getting me into downtown
Sydney. It makes NY look a bit shabby! I loved the old buildings. And did
you see the little black dresses in the Chanel window display near Martin
Place??
Seriously, I am so blessed to have you as friends. It is a wrench leaving
you - despite everything Jenna has been through, there is a sphere of
peace around you and your family and going back into the brash world of New
York isn't going to be easy.
I do hope today is going well and that Jeffrey gets the vibes of what's
coming to him and his evil empire.
I leave at 3.25pm and get in around 11 pm NY time on Thursday.
Sandra is around if you need her. And I will look forward to catching up
Friday.
With a very, very big hug,
Shazza

Hi shazza,
l just got off the phone with Jason and he confirmed that he does intact have your flight logs and journal. I told him you must remain a
confidential source and the way he explained it was that all of the info you pass through me will not be used in court, only as a lead fo
investigation, but he cannot use you as a direct source. He would like your help with the contact information for the following people:
Teala Davis, miles and Kathy, Emmy tayler, and Sarah kellan. If there is anyone else you can think of that may be viable, please let rr
know and I will be happy to pass it on.

Hi there Detective Jenna ...
Can you ask Jason to regard me as a confidential source. He may be afraid
of media ... l can't be seen to be helping him either.
Re his question: I am told the FBI have the flight logs. They also have
the journal. It's the document they confiscated from a houseman called
Alfredo Rodriguez. Maybe Jason means that he wants to know how they
corroborate the flight to London when you were 'given' to Andrew. Here's
how: you had photos from that trip - taken in Granada and London --and
you recalled going to Paris as well and Morocco. I found that itinerary in
the logs (you landed at Luton airport near London) . Also Johanna had
recalled being groped by Andrew one Easter at the NY mansion and that
Ghislaine sat both of you on his knee. You had an identical memory and
there was a flight to NY just before Easter in 01 that I found in the logs.
Love,
Sharon

Hi Jarred,
Really sorry again about the other day, I questioned my husband and father·in•law and nobody knew anything, and it's really weird becaus1
nobody calls me Virginia at home, so anyways it's a mystery unsolved. lol
Here are some of the articles pertaining to the J.E case and i.e "The Story" as requested.
I look forward to speaking with you again shortly!!!

I was sent a message by Brad Edwards wbo suggested that maybe it could be a g__ood idea 10 sr.>eak with the gentleman from
:Vanity Fair when ID)' cootrnct is finished as it is a great way ro gain ublicity for my book and the case, as long as I can
ensure that the writer brio1?s the story out in a classy way and does nots ill the beans on the major ans of the sto . I am
considering it as long as my needs and conditions are met. Do you have any major concerns that could sec this potentially
hindering anything? lf so please let me know as i do trust in yon as my wonderful confidante.
Sandra is still in England covering the wedding, hopefully she'll be back soon to start some serious work with me. J have
received her version of the raw synopsis and so far so good. I look forward to seeing the finale!!
Much Love xoxoxo

Hi Brad,
I am so sorry to hear \he news ofRuslana, and my condolences are with her
family and friends. 1 can say that I have never bad any meelings with her,
sorry not to be of any help there.
With the Vanity Fair piece, [ spoke to Sharon Churcher who had some great
Q9intcrs about why I shouldn't ivc him an exclusive about the case. First
of all "The Story" is full of names of peo le involved in m years s ent
with J.E and I wouldn't want to SJ)Oil the details in my book. See-0ndly lf
J.E finds out that I am doing a book be may try to stop me from publishing
it,
Im sure he has bis ways through his many various contacts, and thirdly I
want to have this book on the shelves for the audience to go buy the second
that my publicity starts. In saying that l still believe it is great
publici!Y for our case and probably a good idea for you to s eak with him
about the case instead of me. If written the right way and brought out as
you having a key witness now speaking with authorities or what not, they
could even use a simple picture ofme to spice it up. I just don't want my
last name "Giuffre" mentioned or the fact that there is a book in the
makings. What do you think about all of this? It will be very helpful to
hear your opinfon tomorrow when we speak.
[ hope you have been doing well and staying busy fighting one scandal at a
time!!

Hi Jenna
Good to hear from you -so nice to gel an email that wasn't connected to work! I have been doing seven days a week on this wedding
and I even wrote five pages yesterday!
However, that will probably be the last of the heavy workload I should think.
As far as the mid June deadline goes, nothing is impossible but you don't want to sell yourself short. All you need for any meetings with
agents is a strong proposal (which ours is, though not complete) and a sample chapter or two.
But, as you mentioned before, we need to gel things on a more formal footing between us before we progress much further.
I have been in touch with agents here to confirm what I thought and ghost writers' percentages vary from 50-50. Seeing as though you
are doing a lot of the initial work yourself, I thought it would be fairer if we worlked on a 7-30 split, in your favour.
Let me know what you think, then we can gel an agreement written up between us and move on. bring ii on!
Hope you are feeling well and that Robbie and the kids are well.
Yours
Sandra

I am glad for you the big wedding is now over, and we can start looking al getting this book up and running. I have had some big named
mag's trying to contact me for some pieces on "the story" and some one else from an editing agency wanting to do a story themselves, so
need to get busy. I have done a lot of work and when you are ready, I'd love for us to coincide our writing. Mid-June is when I am going tc
in the States, and would be my deadline to have this book nearly finished, if not completed. Do you see this as a possibitity?I am looking r,

Hi again buddy,
I thank you for looking into the percentages of Ghostw1iters. I honestly don't know what to do regarding her offer. Whal
do you think about her status compared to another Ghostwriter that charges the same rate? I just want to know she's wortJ
in the end. She said she conferred with her agents in London and they supposedly said it's nonnally 50% cur between boll
writers but because I'm doing most of the work she will generously give me 70% and she'll take 30%. I guess the advanta
of hiring her is that she is local and can help get INT'L coverage, but should I be waiting to sign witb an agent before ber
and I agree to anylbiug? 1 haven't responded back to her yet hoping you could advise me on the best route to take her. l
know you have a wealth of experience in this field and I completely trust in your guidance.
How is it on the front line? I hope your having a good vacation/training aod enjoying time witb your Mother. Take care o
yourself and I look forward to bearing from you soon.

Hi Jenna
Thirty percent is the going rate, at least for to~ ghost writers. I checked
with my friend.
Havia said which, my advice would be to negotiate since you arc doing so
much of the work. I would offer 30 percent of your "net"advance
(the advance is an upfront fee from the publisher ...
The net advance is the money you receive after the agent talces his or her
percentage which is usually JO to 15pc.)

I was hoping I could confide in your advice again. aulo sent me the below messages
regarding the syndicates and from the last time hfm and I emailed and I have actually lost $300-
lf you look at the long list of big named companies that would mean my story/picture was only sold for

Hi Shazza,
This is her final reply, I am not very hopeful about using her al}Ymore.
Do you know of any other reputable Ghostwriters in N.Y.C, I just don't think she is going to
in be in my best interests. See below email from her this a.m ...
Hi Jenna
I am not offended by your comments and I agree with you that this is business but I must say I don't know where you are getting your
information from. All the research I have done here tells me that ghost writer's are usually working on a 50-50 basis. That is the figure quot,
in the 2011 edition of the Writers and Artists Year Book. I have never worked on less than 40% but because you were doing a lot of the init
writing I thought it would be much fairer if my percentage reflected that, that's why I went down to 30%
I do not know of any ghost writer who relinquished screen rights and serialisation rights. The main reason for thal is, obviously, ii is the gho
writer's writing and input that has been sold on for screen or serialisation.
If you want to find someone esle, that is entirely up to you, but those are my terms.
As for Grant. there is no need to get him to sign a confidentiality agreement because there is no need for him to see the manuscript. He on
needs to know who you are and that has been in the paper!
As for sending out to agents, I was going to advise you nearer the time, but 111 do it now. In my opinion your first step should be to make
appointments to see the people in New York when you go there, taking with you the proposal and first chapter. They know what the story i~
and they have expressed an interest. You have got your foot in the door to sell yourself and your book. If you send it to them beforehand ye
are giving them the opportunity lo say no without having met you. And you have a lot going for you personality and intelligence wise so we
want them to see thatl
If those meetings don't produce anything, then we send it to other agents.
I'll get Grant to call you but I have left your phone number at home, so email it to me and I'll pass it on.
Hope all is well.
Sandra

Do you know of any other reputable Ghosl'-Nrlters In N.Y.C, I Just don't think she Is going to

Thanks Buddy!!
Hi Jenna
I am not offended by your comments and I agree With you that !his is business our I must say I don't know where you are getting your
lnfonnation from. All the reseQrch I have done here tells me that ghost writer's ere usually working on a 50-50 besls. That Is the figure quoted
in the 2011 edition of the Writers end Artists Year Book. I have never worked on less then 40% but because you were doing a lot of the Initial
writrig I thought lt would be much fairer' If mt percentage reftected that, that's why I went down to 30%
I do not know of any ghost Writer who relinquished screen rights and ser1ali.satlon rfghls. The main reason for that Is, obviously, it is the gnost
writer's writing -and input that has been sold on for screen or serialisation.
If you went to find someone esle, that is entirely up lo you, but lhose are my terms.
As for Grant, !here is no need lo gel him to sign a confidentiality agreement because there is no need for hrm lo see the manuscript He on!)'
needs lo know who you are and that has been In the paper!
As for sending O\Jt to agents, I was going to advise you nearer the lime, but 111d o it now. In my opinion your first step should be lo make
appointments to see the people in New York when you go there, taking with you the proposalc111d first chapter. They know what the story is
and they have expressed an interesl You have got your fool in the door to sell yourself and your book. If you send it to them beforehand you
are gMng them the opportunity to say no withal.it having mel you. And you have c1 lot going for you personality and intelligence wise so we
wan1 them to see that!
If those meetings <toni produce anything, then we send it to other agents.
l'H gel Grant to call you but I have left your phone number at home, so email It to me aod 111 pass Ho n.
Hope all Is well.
Sandra

Before you make a final decision on Sandra, I would ask her for titles aod publishers of other books she has ghosted
and titles of any films. That's is a legit request since she wants 30pc of everything. Let's see what experience she has.

Dear Jarred Weisfeld,
We spoke on the phone going back a couple months ago regarding the story I am writing caJled, The Billionaires Playbc
Club. I am no longer under any contract and would like to ask you to review my synopsis and if you are interested I woul
love for you to represent me as my literary agent. I have included some of the press that has covered the ongoing case of
Jeffrey Epstein, the worlds richest pedophile, and my good friend and journalist Sharon Churcber has a few from her artic
that she has written to send to you as well I am very serious about getting my book published and believe this story will
cover many genres of interest, not only by those following the lengthy case, but it is also a Woman's story of glitz, glamo
sorrow, com assion, and true love. I hope you enjoy ....
Sincerely,
Virginia Roberts

Hi Jarred
Hopefully you have Virginia's book pitch by now.
She has some amazing names which she can share with you in confidence and I think she also has a human interest
story that could appeal to the Oprah/female set as well as tbe Wall Streeters who follow Epstein - a hedge fund king.
Herc are a few of our stories about Virginia, plus some examples of the massive US and other international media
pickup. Vanity Fair are doing a piece 1 believe in their August issue. The FBI have reopened tbe Epstein case due to
Virginia's revelations. I also am attaching a link to a NY Magazine profile of Epstein .....w ritten before his world
combusted_T he FBI believe he was essentially running a p1ivate - and mobile -- brothel for some of the world's
richest and most influential men.
He got off the first time round after retaining Kenneth Starr (who witcbhunted Bill Clinton) and Alan Dcrshowitz
(von Bulow's appeal lawyer, who inspired the movie Reversal of Fortune). TI1e US Justice Dept is investigating
conuption allegations against at least one prosecutor involved in the case.
