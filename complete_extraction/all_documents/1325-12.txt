1 Q All right. Do you know how you came to be
2 the doctor for Virginia Giuffre?
A No. I -- she would have filled out a new
3
patient packet and showed up for a new patient
4
5 appointment for a particular reason. I reviewed it.
Jane Doe 2
6
7
8 Q Do you know where that new patient packet
9 is now?
10 A It's going to be scanned in the computer.
11 If you don't have it, I brought my computer. I can
12 probably scan it and print it out or just print it
13 out.
14 Q Is that among the documents that you have
15 next to you?
16 A The new patient packet isn't here, but I
17 have it I should have it on my computer. I could
18 probably log in and print it, to be honest. It
19 wouldn't be that hard. I assumed that the hospital
20 is taking care of all the documentation that was
21 requested. So I didn't actually bring it.
22 Q I understand.
23 A I actually have it, happen to have it with
24 me.
25 Q All right. Why don't we -- we can

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1325-12 Filed 01/04/24 Page 7 of 15

1 probably do that when we take a break in just a few
2 minutes, and I can tell you how to get on the
3 Internet and we'll see if that works.
4 A Um-hum.
5 Q Do you know how many times that you saw
6 Virginia Giuffre?
7 A Once.
8 Q Do you know whether she was referred to
9 you by another doctor?
10 A No.
11 Q Do you mean no, you don't know or
12 A I have no idea. I have no idea. I don't
13 know why she would have been referred. Most the time
14 people are referring out.
15 Q Right.
16 A They don't refer back to a general
17 practitioner.
18 Q No one ever refers anyone to you?
19 A It generally goes the other direction.
20 Well, other patients might refer people to me, and
21 that happens, but
22 Q Okay. Do you know if you treat
23 Ms. Giuffre's children in your practice?
24 A Not that I'm aware of.
25 Q Do you know a woman by the name of Lynn

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1325-12 Filed 01/04/24 Page 8 of 15

1 Miller?
2 A I know several Millers.
3 Q Who works at Saint Thomas More Hospital?
4 A I think so, yeah. That sounds familiar,
5 yeah.
6 Q Do you know her professionally?
7 A Not really.
8 Q Okay.
9 A I mean, her name sounds familiar.
Q Do you know of any connection between Lynn
11 Miller and Virginia Giuffre?
12 A None. I have met Virginia once. I only
13 saw her once, a year ago. That's the extent of my --
14 Q Have you ever read any media reports about
15 Ms. Giuffre?
16 A No. No, I haven't. I don't know anything
17 about it.
18 Q Okay. Do you know how long --
19 A She -- I believe she mentioned that it was
20 some kind of -- mentioned something about being a
21 famous sexual abuse something.
22 Q You haven't read any of the reports?
23 A I have no idea.
24 Q Okay. I'm just trying to establish your
sources information.

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1325-12 Filed 01/04/24 Page 9 of 15
Agren Blando Court Reporting & Video, Inc.
1 A Yeah.
2 Q So if you had information about
Ms. Giuffre, other than your visit --
3
4 A Yeah.
5 Q -- do you know another source?
6 A No.
7 Q From family members?
8 A No.
9 Q From community members, anything?
10 A Nothing.
11 Q Do you know how long your visit with her
12 lasted?
13 A It -- sometimes I document time spent, but
14 not always. I mean, it's not important. They're
15 half-hour visits typically. It would have been a
16 half hour or less, I would expect.
17 Q All right. Before looking at your
18 records, is there anything about Ms. Giuffre that you
19 recall just from the top of your head?
20 I understand you see many, many patients
21 and this was a year ago. So you tell me.
22 A Nothing. I saw her once. And when I went
back and read the note, I went, Oh, yeah, I remember
23
24 someone mentioning about being in a sexual abuse
25 trial or something, some kind of sexual abuse thing.

1 Q That's the only unusual part that stuck
2 out?
A Yeah, and I don't really remember anything
3
about her at all, actually, I don't.
4
5 Q Do you know what she looks like?
6 A No, I don't remember. It was one time a
7 year ago. I don't remember.
8 Q I understand. Okay. If it's okay with
9 you, I would like to take a break and see if we can
10 pull up the other records because I don't want to go
11 through my questions and then go back and look at
12 those records. I'd rather do it one time.
13 A Okay.
14 Q Is that all right?
15 A Yeah, I'm fine with that.
16 MS. MENNINGER: All right. Let's go off
17 the record.
18 (Recess taken from 9:41 a.m. to
19 10:07 a.m.)
20 (Exhibit 4 marked.)
21 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) So we're back on the
22 record. All right.
23 I'm going to give you a document marked as
Exhibit 4 . And I'm going to make a small record
24
about what just took place off the record, which is
25

Case 1:15-cv-07433-LAP Document 1325-12 Filed 01/04/24 Page 11 of 15

1 that you, as I understand it, and tell me if I'm
2 wrong, have access to medical records from your
3 office on your laptop, correct?
4 A Yes.
5 Q Okay. And you were able to get on your
6 laptop and print out records related to Ms. Giuffre
7 that you had on that laptop, correct?
8 A Yes.
9 Q And we printed that out and made copies
10 for everyone here, and that's what you see in front
11 of you as Exhibit 4, correct?
12 A Yes.
13 Q We made those printouts on a portable
14 printer. So they're not the best quality, correct?
15 A Correct.
16 Q And some portions are not printing out as
17 well?
18 A Yes.
19 Q And you, I think, would be okay with
20 sending us a more complete set later?
21 A Yes.
22 Q All right. I'm going to take just a
23 minute to review it.
24 Can you tell us what the records that you
25 just printed out in Exhibit 4 represent?

1 A Generally it's demographics information
2 and then a list of medications, a list of surgeries,
3 a list of family medical history, and then a list of
4 physical complaints that there's some -- it's called
5 review of systems, things someone has been feeling
6 and self-reported in the last two weeks.
7 Q Okay. So is this typically is this
8 patient information document typically in the
9 patient's handwriting?
10 A Yes.
11 Q And I presume you don't know Ms. Giuffre's
12 handwriting?
13 A No.
14 Q But it's a practice to ask the patient to
15 fill these forms out?
16 A Yes, and then have it there before their
17 appointment.
18 Q All right. So if I see the date reflected
19 on the top of the first page as May 21st, 2015 --
20 A Um-hum.
21 Q -- do you believe that to be the date that
22 you actually saw Ms. Giuffre?
23 A Probably, yes.
24 Q Okay.
25 A Sometimes people will bring it in early,

1 but yeah.
2 Q Okay. Why don't we go ahead and mark
3 Exhibit 5, which will be helpful as we're going
4 through this.
5 (Exhibit 5 marked.)
6 Q (BY MS. MENNINGER) And I'm going to ask
7 you to keep 4 and 5 kind of close by, and we'll talk
8 about them.
9 Do you recognize Exhibit 5?
10 A Yes. That's the visit note.
11 Q And the visit note of Ms. Giuffre's visit
12 with you?
13 A Yes.
Q In your office?
15 A Yes.
Q And after looking at Exhibit 5, can you
17 tell what date it is that you actually saw
18 Ms. Giuffre?
19 A 5/21/2015.
20 Q Okay. Is that also the same date as the
21 patient intake form
22 A Yes.
23 Q -- in Exhibit 4?
24 A Yes.
25 Q All right. Do you recall whether you
