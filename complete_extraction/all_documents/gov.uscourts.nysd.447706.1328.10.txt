2 A. I think everyone here can
3 understand what intercourse is , is when you
4 have sex. I don't know how to say
5 intercourse any other way, having sex with
6 somebody. Perhaps you would like to define
7 it for me .
8 Q. I ' m trying to get your definition
9 right now because you are the witness. When
10 you use the term intercourse , what are you
11 referring to?
12 A. I'm referring to a penis entering
13 someone ' s vagina.
14 Q. Now, have you ever engaged in oral
15 sex?
16 A. In my life?
17 MR . PAGLIUCA: There are specific
18 areas that the court has allowed inquiry
19 into, and those are delineated in the
20 court ' s order of June 20th. The
21 open-ended 11 Have you ever engaged in
22 oral sex" is not part of the court ' s
23 order at page 10 , and the court
24 specifically indicated that sexual
25 activity of third parties who bear no

2 anyone in any of Mr. Epstein ' s five homes
3 that you have identified?
4 A. Yes .
5 Q. With whom?
6 A. Mr. Epstein .
7 Q. Did you ever have oral sex with
8 anyone in any of Mr. Epstein ' s five homes
9 that you've identified other than
10 Mr. Epstein?
11 MR. PAGLIUCA : I ' m going to
12 instruct you not to answer, unless you
13 tie it to a specific individual related
14 to this case per the court ' s order .
15 MR. BOIES: I think the court ' s
16 order specifically permits this question
17 with respect to occasions related to
18 this case. If you instruct her not to
19 answer, all you ' re going to do is bring
20 her back. That ' s up to you .
21 MR. PAGLIUCA : It's up to you as
22 the questioner, Mr. Boies. The court ' s
23 order says the defendant need not answer
24 questions that relate to none of these
25 subjects or that is clearly not relevant

2 Johanna?
3 A. I would not know . I would say no .
4 Q. Did you engage in sexual activities
5 with Johanna?
6 A . No .
7 Q. Do you know how Johanna came to
8 know Mr Epstein?
9 A. I met her at her university and she
10 came to answer phones.
11 Q. When you say she came to answer
12 phones , where?
13 A . In Palm Beach
14 Q. At Mr. Epstein ' s home in Palm
15 Beach?
16 A. Yes .
17 Q. So is it fair to say that Johanna
18 was initially hired to answer telephones ,
19 according to your testimony?
20 MR. PAGLIUCA: This has already
21 been testi fied to Mr. Boies . We are
22 repeating testimony now.
23 MR. BOIES: I think in the context
24 of the witness answers , these are fair
1
25 questions.

2 Now, I ' ve asked you before , if you
3 want to instruct her not to answer, if
4 you want to go to the judge , we are
5 happy to do that, but I would suggest ,
6 in the interest of moving it along, that
7 you stop these speeches .
8 MR. PAGLIUCA: You are not moving
9 it along is the problem, so maybe we
10 should call the court and get some
11 direction here, because I am not going
12 to sit here and rehash the testimony we
13 already gave.

2 or argue this in front of Judge Sweet.
3 But I will simply start referring
4 you back to the transcript and
5 instructing the witness not to answer
6 when I think we are getting into some
7 things that have been asked and answered
8 already .
9 MR. BOIES : Exactly the procedure
10 that I have proposed from the beginning .
11 If you think a question is out of
12 bounds , instruct not to answer and we
13 will then let the judge decide it .
14 BY MR. BOIES:
15 Q. How did it happen , Ms . Maxwell ,
16 that Johanna, who had been hired to answer
17 the phones, ended up giving massages to you
18 and Mr. Epstein?
19 MR. PAGLIUCA: I ' m going to
20 instruct you not to answer the question ~
21 This has been previously, the subject of
22 your former deposition, it doesn't fall
23 into any of the categories ordered by
24 the court, and so you don ' t need to
25 answer that.

2 Q. Was Johanna paid for the massages
3 that she gave you?
4 A. I didn ' t pay her , so I believe she
5 was paid .
6 Q. Who paid her?
7 A. I don 1 t know who paid her .
8 MR. PAGLIUCA : Again, you ' ve
9 already answered that there was no
10 sexual activity between yourself and
11 Mr. Epstein related to these massages
12 That's record testimony today. That's
13 within the scope of the court ' s order .
14 The rest of this is outside the scope of
15 the court ' s order, and I instruct you
16 not to answer.
17 MR. BOIES : You are taking the
18 position that as long as she said says
19 that a massage did not involve sexual
20 activity, we cannot ask about massages .
21 That ' s your view?
22 MR. PAGLIUCA : On this particular
23 questioning , yes .

2 massages that she gave Mr. Epstein?
3 MR. PAGLIUCA: You just asked this
4 question , and I told her not to answer.
5 I will tell her not to answer again for
6 the same reasons
7 Q. Do you know how much Mr . Epstein
8 paid Johanna to give massages?
9 MR PAGLIUCA: Same instruction to
10 the witness. Why do you believe this is
11 within the scope of the court 1 s order?
12 MR. BOIES: Because of the court 1 s
13 reference to massages , and because I
14 think how much a girl who was hired to
15 answer the phone was paid to give a
16 "massage" goes to whether there actually
17 was or was not sexual activity involved .
18 MR. PAGLIUCA: The witness has
19 testified there wasn't.
20 MR. BOIES: Perhaps it will
21 surprise you, I think it should not ,
22 that I do not believe in my deposition I
23 need to simply accept her
24 characterization without
25 cross-examination. Now, that ' s

2 something the judge can decide . but a
3 question as to how much this young girl
4 was being paid for a "massage " , I think
5 goes directly to the issue of sexual
6 activity
7 MR. PAGLIUCA: Here is the problem,
8 Mr. Boies , at the first deposition,
9 there were very limited instructions not
10 to answer and the witness was not told
11 not to answer questions about how much
12 people were paid or not paid or any of
13 those subject matters. The witness was
14 only instructed not to answer about
15 sexual activity concerning adults in the
16 home .
17 None of this came up during the
18 deposition, and you just don•t get a
19 chance to redo the deposition because
20 you feel like you want to .
21 So the judge s order is in the
1
22 context of the instructions to the
23 witness not to answer in the first
24 deposition, which is simply sexual
25 activity involving adults, which was the

2 intercourse with women other than what you
3 have testified to already?
4 MR. PAGLIUCA: First of all , I
5 object to the form and foundation and
6 it's also outside of the court ' s order
7 because it's unclear as you question,
8 and I specifically direct you to the
9 last line of the court's order: Sexual
10 activity of third parties who bear no
11 knowledge or relation to key events ,
12 individuals or locations in this case .
13 MR . BOIES : This simply asks yes or
14 no , and I think that it is an
15 appropriate question given some of the
16 witness ' prior answers, but there is no
17 point in debating it, because if you
18 instruct her not to answer, the judge
19 will decide whether it's appropriate _

2 A. I don ' t recall ever hearing such a

4 Q. You know Mr . Les Wexner , correct?
5 A. I do.
6 Q. Do you know whether or not Maria
7 Farmer was ever at Mr . Wexner ' s property in
8 Ohio?
9 MR. PAGLIUCA: Can you tell me how
10 that relates to this order, counselor?
11 MR. BOIES: Yes , I think it goes
12 directly to the sexual activity related
13 to Maria Farmer and what Mr . Epstein was
14 doing with Maria Farmer .
15 Again, you can instruct not to
16 answer.
17 MR. PAGLIUCA : I ' m trying to
18 understand why you are asking these
19 questions before I
20 MR. BOIES: I ' m asking these
21 questions because these are people who
22 not only have been publicly written
23 about in terms of the sexual activity
24 that they were put into in connection
25 with Mr. Epstein, but the person who

2 wrote about them is somebody who talked
3 to this witness about it, and I think
4 that this is more than easily understood
5 cross-examination .
6 MR. PAGLIUCA: Your question was ,
7 do you know whether or not Maria Farmer
8 was ever at Mr. Wexner ' s property in

10 MR . BOIES : Yes . And if you let
11 her answer, you will see where it leads
12 If you won 't let her answer, the judge
13 is going to determine it . And I just
14 suggest to you that you stop these
15 speeches and stop debating, because you
16 are not going to convince me not to
17 follow-up on these questions . If you
18 can convince the court to truncate the

20 you ' re doing is dragging this deposition

8 that Mr . Figueroa, who she also does not
