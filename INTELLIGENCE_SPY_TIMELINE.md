## Potential Intelligence Indicators

### **1. Surveillance Infrastructure**

#### **Video Equipment**
**Evidence from Juan Alessi (House Manager) Deposition**:

> "How did you know then that the young technician from Ohio maintained the computers and the video equipment?" - Deposition question

**Context**:
- Video equipment throughout Palm Beach mansion
- Maintained by specialized technician from Ohio
- Alessi "didn't even know the video equipment existed until he read the FBI report"
- Equipment was hidden/not obvious to staff

**Locations**:
- Upstairs and downstairs
- Multiple rooms
- Staff house
- Maxwell's office (12x5 feet, under stairs)

#### **Photography**
**Evidence from Johanna Sjoberg Deposition**:

> "Were there pictures on her computer of the girls who came to give massages?" - Question about Maxwell's computer

**Context**:
- Photos appeared to be taken without subjects knowing
- "Did they look as though the person being photographed knew that they were being photographed?" "No, ma'am."
- Photos taken at "parties in big reception or banquet"
- Casual, candid photography

#### **Camera Incident - Johanna Sjoberg**
**Evidence**:

> "Maxwell offered to buy you a camera?" "Yes."
> 
> "Was there anything you were supposed to do in order to get the camera?"
> 
> "She told me -- called me after I had left and said, I have the camera for you, but you cannot receive it yet because you came here and didn't finish your job and I had to finish it for you."

**Analysis**: Camera used as incentive/control mechanism for sexual acts

---

### **2. Passport Confiscation**

#### **Additional Passport Incident**
**Evidence from Witness Testimony**:

> "do you have a passport, do you have a phone? And she says no, and she says Ghislaine took my passport. And I said what, and she says Sarah took her passport and her phone and gave it to Ghislaine Maxwell, and at that point she said that she was threatened."

**Pattern**:
